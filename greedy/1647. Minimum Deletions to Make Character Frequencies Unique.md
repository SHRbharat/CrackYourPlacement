# [1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.

Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.

### Approach Used :

-   Frequency Count: We count the frequency of each character in the string s and store it in the freq array.
-   Sorting Frequencies: We sort the frequencies in descending order to handle the highest frequencies first.
-   Making Frequencies Unique:
    -   Use an unordered set usedFrequencies to keep track of frequencies that have already been used.
    -   For each frequency f in the sorted list, if f is already in usedFrequencies, reduce f by 1 and increment the deletion count until f becomes unique.
    -   Insert the unique f into usedFrequencies.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletions(string s) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        
        // Step 1: Count the frequency of each character
        for (char c : s) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        // Step 2: Sort frequencies in descending order
        sort(freq.rbegin(), freq.rend());
        
        // Step 3: Ensure all frequencies are unique
        unordered_set<int> usedFrequencies;
        int deletions = 0;
        
        for (int f : freq) {
            while (f > 0 && usedFrequencies.find(f) != usedFrequencies.end()) {
                f--;
                deletions++;
            }
            if (f > 0) {
                usedFrequencies.insert(f);
            }
        }
        
        return deletions;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** where n is the length of the string. Counting frequencies takes O(n), sorting the fixed-size array (26) takes constant time, and adjusting frequencies involves at most 26 iterations for each unique frequency.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
