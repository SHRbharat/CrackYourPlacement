# [134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique
### Approach Used :

-   Total Gas and Cost Calculation: Compute the total gas available and the total cost required to travel around the circuit.
-   Feasibility Check: If the total gas is less than the total cost, it's impossible to complete the circuit, so we return -1.
-   Finding the Starting Index:
        -   Use a variable tank to keep track of the current gas in the tank.
        -   Iterate through each gas station and update the tank by adding the net gas available at that station (gas[i] - cost[i]).
        -   If tank becomes negative, it means starting from the current starting index to the current station i is not feasible. Thus, reset the starting index to i + 1 and reset the tank to 0.
-   Return the Result: If the total gas is greater than or equal to the total cost, return the start_index, otherwise return -1.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int total_gas = 0, total_cost = 0, tank = 0, start_index = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.size(); ++i) {
            total_gas += gas[i];
            total_cost += cost[i];
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i];
            
            if (tank < 0) {
                start_index = i + 1;
                tank = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return (total_gas >= total_cost) ? start_index : -1;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** We make a single pass through the arrays.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
