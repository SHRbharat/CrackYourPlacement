# [1743. Restore the Array From Adjacent Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-the-array-from-adjacent-pairs/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

There is an integer array nums that consists of n unique elements, but you have forgotten it. However, you do remember every pair of adjacent elements in nums.

You are given a 2D integer array adjacentPairs of size n - 1 where each adjacentPairs[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that the elements ui and vi are adjacent in nums.

It is guaranteed that every adjacent pair of elements nums[i] and nums[i+1] will exist in adjacentPairs, either as [nums[i], nums[i+1]] or [nums[i+1], nums[i]]. The pairs can appear in any order.

Return the original array nums. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.
### Approach Used :

-   Graph Construction: We use an unordered map to build the graph and another unordered map to keep track of the degree (number of neighbors) of each node.
-   Identify Start Node: The start node is identified as the node with degree 1 (it only has one neighbor).
-   Restore Array: Using Depth-First Search (DFS), we traverse the graph starting from the identified start node and build the result array. We use a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> restoreArray(vector<vector<int>>& adjacentPairs) {
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> graph;
        unordered_map<int, int> degree;
        
        // Build the graph and count the degree of each node
        for (const auto& pair : adjacentPairs) {
            int u = pair[0], v = pair[1];
            graph[u].push_back(v);
            graph[v].push_back(u);
            degree[u]++;
            degree[v]++;
        }
        
        // Find the start node which has degree 1
        int start;
        for (const auto& [key, val] : degree) {
            if (val == 1) {
                start = key;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        // Restore the array using DFS
        vector<int> result;
        unordered_set<int> visited;
        stack<int> s;
        s.push(start);
        
        while (!s.empty()) {
            int node = s.top();
            s.pop();
            result.push_back(node);
            visited.insert(node);
            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                if (visited.find(neighbor) == visited.end()) {
                    s.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** where n is the number of elements in the adjacentPairs. Building the graph, identifying the start node, and performing DFS each take linear time.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** for storing the graph, degree counts, the result array, and the visited set.
