# [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

### Approach Used :

-   Sorting: By sorting intervals by their end times, you ensure that you always deal with the interval that finishes earliest, which minimizes the chances of overlaps with subsequent intervals.
-   Greedy Choice: By always choosing the interval that ends first, you maximize the remaining room for future intervals, reducing the need to remove more intervals.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        if (intervals.empty()) return 0;
        
        // Sort intervals based on their end times
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });
        
        int count = 0; // Count of intervals to remove
        int end = intervals[0][1]; // End time of the last interval added
        
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); ++i) {
            if (intervals[i][0] < end) {
                // There's an overlap, so we need to remove this interval
                ++count;
            } else {
                // Update the end time to the end time of the current interval
                end = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(nlogn):** due to sorting

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
