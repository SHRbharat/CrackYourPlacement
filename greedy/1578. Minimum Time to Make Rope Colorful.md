# [1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Alice has n balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a 0-indexed string colors where colors[i] is the color of the ith balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be colorful. She does not want two consecutive balloons to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it colorful. You are given a 0-indexed integer array neededTime where neededTime[i] is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the ith balloon from the rope.

Return the minimum time Bob needs to make the rope colorful.

### Approach Used :

-   Traverse the String: The outer loop iterates over each balloon, and the inner while loop finds all consecutive balloons of the same color.
-   Calculate Costs: For each group of consecutive balloons of the same color, find the balloon with the maximum needed time (which should not be removed). Sum the removal times of the other balloons in the group and add this to the total cost.
-   Update Index: Move to the next group by updating the index.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(string colors, vector<int>& neededTime) {
        int n = colors.size();
        int totalCost = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // Find the length of the current group of consecutive balloons with the same color
            int j = i;
            int maxTime = neededTime[i];
            int sumTime = neededTime[i];
            
            while (j < n - 1 && colors[j] == colors[j + 1]) {
                ++j;
                sumTime += neededTime[j];
                maxTime = max(maxTime, neededTime[j]);
            }
            
            // Add the cost of removing all balloons in the group except the one with the maximum time
            totalCost += (sumTime - maxTime);
            
            // Move to the next group
            i = j;
        }
        
        return totalCost;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** traverses the string once

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
