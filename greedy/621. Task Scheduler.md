# [621. Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.
### Approach Used :

-   Count Task Frequencies: First, we count the frequency of each task using an array count of size 26 (for each letter from 'A' to 'Z').
-   Sort Frequencies: We sort the frequencies in descending order to prioritize scheduling the most frequent tasks first.
-   Calculate Idle Slots: Calculate the number of idle slots required by using the most frequent task. The number of idle slots is (maxCount - 1) * n, where maxCount is the frequency of the most frequent task.
-   Fill Idle Slots: Reduce the idle slots by placing other tasks into these slots. We subtract the minimum of the task's frequency or maxCount - 1 from the idle slots for each task.
-   Compute Result: If there are still idle slots left after filling them with other tasks, the total intervals required will be the sum of the tasks' size and the remaining idle slots. Otherwise, it will simply be the number of tasks.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        vector<int> count(26, 0);
        for (char task : tasks) {
            count[task - 'A']++;
        }
        
        sort(count.begin(), count.end(), greater<int>());
        
        int maxCount = count[0];
        int idleSlots = (maxCount - 1) * n;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < 26 && count[i] > 0; ++i) {
            idleSlots -= min(count[i], maxCount - 1);
        }
        
        return idleSlots > 0 ? idleSlots + tasks.size() : tasks.size();
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** where n is the number of tasks. Counting task frequencies takes O(n) time and sorting the fixed size array (26) takes constant time.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
