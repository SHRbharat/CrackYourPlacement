# [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

### Approach Used :

-   To solve the problem of maximizing profit from stock prices where you can buy and/or sell on each day, the key insight is to recognize that you should capture every upward trend in the prices. Essentially, you want to accumulate profits whenever there is a price increase from one day to the next.

-   Iterate Through Prices: Traverse the array of prices from the beginning to the end.
-   Capture Profits: Whenever you find that the price of the next day is higher than the current dayâ€™s price, add the difference to your total profit. This is because you can simulate buying on the current day and selling on the next day.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            // If the price today is greater than the price yesterday, capture the profit
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** Each price is checked once in a single pass through the array.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
