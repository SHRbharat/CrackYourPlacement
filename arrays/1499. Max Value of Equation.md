# [1499. Max Value of Equation](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-value-of-equation/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

You are given an array points containing the coordinates of points on a 2D plane, sorted by the x-values, where points[i] = [xi, yi] such that xi < xj for all 1 <= i < j <= points.length. You are also given an integer k.

Return the maximum value of the equation yi + yj + |xi - xj| where |xi - xj| <= k and 1 <= i < j <= points.length.

It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy the constraint |xi - xj| <= k.

### Approach Used :

-   To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of potential candidates for the maximum value of the equation. The idea is to maintain a sliding window of points that satisfy the constraint | xi - xj | <= k, and for each point, we compute the potential maximum value by leveraging the properties of the heap.

- Use a max-heap to store pairs of the form (yi-xi, xi)
- For each point (xj,yj), pop elements from the heap where the x-coordinate is not within the window of (xjâˆ’k,xj].
- Calculate the value yi + yj + |xi - xj| for the current point using the top of the heap.
- Push the current point (uj - xj , xj) onto the heap.
- Track the maximum value during this process.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxValueOfEquation(vector<vector<int>>& points, int k) {
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq; // max-heap of (yi - xi, xi)
        int maxVal = INT_MIN;
        
        for (auto& point : points) {
            int xj = point[0];
            int yj = point[1];
            
            // Remove elements from the heap that are out of the window
            while (!pq.empty() && xj - pq.top().second > k) {
                pq.pop();
            }
            
            // Calculate the potential max value with the current point
            if (!pq.empty()) {
                maxVal = max(maxVal, yj + xj + pq.top().first);
            }
            
            // Push the current point (yi - xi, xi) onto the heap
            pq.push({yj - xj, xj});
        }
        
        return maxVal;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(nlogn):** Each point is pushed and popped from the heap at most once, and heap operations (push and pop) take O(logn) time.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** The space complexity is due to the heap,
