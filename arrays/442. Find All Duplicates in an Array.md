# [442. Find All Duplicates in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given an integer array nums of length n where all the integers of nums are in the range [1, n] and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses only constant extra space.

### Approach Used :

-   Use Indexing for Marking: Iterate through the array and for each number nums[i], use its absolute value abs(nums[i]) as an index to mark the presence of this number.
-   Mark the Presence: For each number nums[i], mark the element at index abs(nums[i]) - 1 as negative if it is not already negative. If it is already negative, it means the number abs(nums[i]) has appeared before.
-   Collect Duplicates: As we mark the elements, if we encounter an element that is already marked (negative), add the corresponding number to the result list since it indicates a duplicate.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> result;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int index = abs(nums[i]) - 1;
            
            // If the value at nums[index] is negative, it means the number at this index has been seen before
            if (nums[index] < 0) {
                result.push_back(abs(nums[i]));
            } else {
                // Mark the value at nums[index] as visited by making it negative
                nums[index] = -nums[index];
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** tranerses the array once

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
