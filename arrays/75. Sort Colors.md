# [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

### Approach Used :

-   This code implements the Dutch National Flag algorithm to sort an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s in linear time. It uses three pointers (low, mid, high) to partition the array into three regions, ensuring that all 0s are at the beginning, 1s in the middle, and 2s at the end.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0;
        int mid = 0;
        int high = nums.size()-1;
        while(mid<=high)
        {
            if(nums[mid]==0)
            {
                swap(nums[mid], nums[low]);
                mid++;
                low++;
            }
            else if (nums[mid]==1)
            {
                mid++;
            }
            else
            {
                swap(nums[mid], nums[high]);
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** Each element is processed at most once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
