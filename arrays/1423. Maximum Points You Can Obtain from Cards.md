# [1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

There are several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array cardPoints.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly k cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array cardPoints and the integer k, return the maximum score you can obtain.

### Approach Used :

-   Calculate Total Sum: Compute the total sum of the array cardPoints.
-   Initialize the Window: Initialize a window of size n-k to find the minimum sum of any subarray of length n-k.
-   Slide the Window: Slide the window from the start of the array to the end, keeping track of the minimum sum of the window.
-   Compute Maximum Score: The maximum score is the total sum of the array minus the minimum sum of the window (subarray of length n-k).

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(vector<int>& cardPoints, int k) {
        int n = cardPoints.size();
        int totalSum = 0;
        
        // Calculate the total sum of the card points
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalSum += cardPoints[i];
        }
        
        // If k is equal to the length of the array, return the total sum
        if (k == n) {
            return totalSum;
        }
        
        // Find the minimum sum of subarray of length n - k
        int windowSize = n - k;
        int minSubarraySum = 0;
        int currentSubarraySum = 0;
        
        // Calculate the initial window sum
        for (int i = 0; i < windowSize; i++) {
            currentSubarraySum += cardPoints[i];
        }
        
        minSubarraySum = currentSubarraySum;
        
        // Slide the window across the array
        for (int i = windowSize; i < n; i++) {
            currentSubarraySum += cardPoints[i] - cardPoints[i - windowSize];
            minSubarraySum = min(minSubarraySum, currentSubarraySum);
        }
        
        // The maximum score is the total sum minus the minimum subarray sum
        return totalSum - minSubarraySum;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** Overall, the algorithm performs a few passes over the array, each taking O(n) time. Hence, the total time complexity is O(n).

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
