# [84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

### Approach Used :

-   Initialize a stack to keep track of bar indices and a variable maxArea to store the maximum area found.
-   Iterate through the heights array, and for each bar, do the following:
    -   While the stack is not empty and the current bar height is less than the height of the bar at the index stored at the top of the stack, we pop the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle that can be formed with the popped bar as the smallest bar.
    -   Calculate the width of the rectangle as the difference between the current index and the index of the new top of the stack minus one. If the stack is empty, it means the popped bar is the smallest so far, and its width extends to the current index.
    -   Update maxArea with the maximum area calculated.
-   After iterating through the array, there might be some bars left in the stack. We need to pop the remaining bars and calculate the area in a similar manner as described above.
-   Return maxArea

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& heights) {
        stack<int> st;
        int maxArea = 0;
        int n = heights.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // Ensure the stack is in increasing order
            while (!st.empty() && heights[i] < heights[st.top()]) {
                int height = heights[st.top()];
                st.pop();
                int width = st.empty() ? i : i - st.top() - 1;
                maxArea = max(maxArea, height * width);
            }
            st.push(i);
        }
        
        // Process remaining bars in the stack
        while (!st.empty()) {
            int height = heights[st.top()];
            st.pop();
            int width = st.empty() ? n : n - st.top() - 1;
            maxArea = max(maxArea, height * width);
        }
        
        return maxArea;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):**  Each bar is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, resulting in a linear time complexity.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** In the worst case, all bars are stored in the stack.
