# [289. Game of Life](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.

### Approach Used :

-   Directions Array: This array helps to check all 8 possible neighbors of a cell.
-   Counting Live Neighbors: For each cell, iterate over its neighbors and count the number of live cells.
-   Applying the Rules:
    -   If a live cell has fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors, it transitions to dead, marked by -1.
    -   If a dead cell has exactly 3 live neighbors, it transitions to live, marked by 2.
-   Finalizing the Board: After applying the rules, convert temporary markers (-1 to 0 and 2 to 1) to finalize the board state.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        int m = board.size();
        int n = board[0].size();
        
        // Directions array to check all 8 neighbors
        vector<vector<int>> directions = {
            {1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1},
            {1, 1}, {1, -1}, {-1, 1}, {-1, -1}
        };
        
        // Iterate through each cell
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                int liveNeighbors = 0;
                
                // Count live neighbors
                for (auto dir : directions) {
                    int ni = i + dir[0];
                    int nj = j + dir[1];
                    if (ni >= 0 && ni < m && nj >= 0 && nj < n && abs(board[ni][nj]) == 1) {
                        ++liveNeighbors;
                    }
                }
                
                // Apply the rules
                if (board[i][j] == 1 && (liveNeighbors < 2 || liveNeighbors > 3)) {
                    board[i][j] = -1;  // Live to dead
                }
                if (board[i][j] == 0 && liveNeighbors == 3) {
                    board[i][j] = 2;   // Dead to live
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Finalize the board by replacing the temporary values
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == -1) {
                    board[i][j] = 0;  // Live to dead
                } else if (board[i][j] == 2) {
                    board[i][j] = 1;  // Dead to live
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(mÃ—n):** where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the board. Each cell and its neighbors are checked once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
