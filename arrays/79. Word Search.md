# [79. Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

### Approach Used :

-   DFS Function: Use a recursive DFS function to explore all possible paths from each starting cell in the grid. The function will attempt to match the current letter of the word with the letter in the grid and then move to adjacent cells.
-   Boundary Checks: Ensure that the DFS does not go out of bounds and only moves to adjacent cells that match the current character in the word.
-   Backtracking: Mark cells as visited by temporarily changing their values (e.g., using a special character or flag), and backtrack by restoring the cell's original value after exploring all possible paths from that cell.
-   Start DFS from Each Cell: Iterate through each cell in the grid and start a DFS if the cell matches the first character of the word.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool exist(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word) {
        if (board.empty() || board[0].empty()) return false;
        int rows = board.size();
        int cols = board[0].size();
        
        // Define the directions for moving in the grid
        vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};
        
        // Helper function for DFS
        function<bool(int, int, int)> dfs = [&](int r, int c, int index) {
            if (index == word.size()) return true; // All characters matched
            
            if (r < 0 || r >= rows || c < 0 || c >= cols || board[r][c] != word[index]) {
                return false; // Out of bounds or character does not match
            }
            
            // Mark the cell as visited
            char temp = board[r][c];
            board[r][c] = '#';
            
            // Explore all 4 directions
            for (const auto& dir : directions) {
                int newRow = r + dir.first;
                int newCol = c + dir.second;
                if (dfs(newRow, newCol, index + 1)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
            
            // Restore the cell's original value before backtracking
            board[r][c] = temp;
            return false;
        };
        
        // Start DFS from each cell in the grid
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; ++r) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; ++c) {
                if (board[r][c] == word[0] && dfs(r, c, 0)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m*n*4<sup>L</sup>):** where m and n are the dimensions of the grid and L is the length of the word. In the worst case, each cell is visited multiple times, and the recursive exploration can branch out up to 4 directions.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(L):** for the recursion stack in the worst case, where L is the length of the word.
