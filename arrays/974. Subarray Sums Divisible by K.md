# [974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of non-empty subarrays that have a sum divisible by k.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Approach Used :

-   The approach uses a cumulative sum to track the sum of elements up to the current index, calculating the remainder when this sum is divided by k. By maintaining a map of these remainders and their frequencies, the algorithm can efficiently count subarrays whose sums are divisible by k by checking if the same remainder has been seen before, which indicates the presence of such subarrays. The map helps in handling the remainders and adjusting for negative remainders to ensure correctness.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysDivByK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> remainder_count;
        remainder_count[0] = 1; // Initialize with 0 remainder to handle subarrays starting from index 0
        
        int cumulative_sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for(int num : nums) {
            cumulative_sum += num;
            int remainder = cumulative_sum % k;
            
            // Ensure the remainder is non-negative
            if(remainder < 0) {
                remainder += k;
            }
            
            // If this remainder has been seen before, add the count of those occurrences to the result
            if(remainder_count.find(remainder) != remainder_count.end()) {
                count += remainder_count[remainder];
            }
            
            // Increment the count of this remainder in the map
            remainder_count[remainder]++;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** his is because we make a single pass through the array

### Space Complexity:
- **O(k):** or the remainder_count map. In the worst case, there can be at most k unique remainders (from 0 to k-1).
