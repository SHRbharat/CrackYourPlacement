# [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

### Approach Used :

-   Initialize Two Pointers: Start with two pointers, one at the beginning (left) and one at the end (right) of the array.
-   Calculate Area: Calculate the area formed by the lines at these two pointers and the x-axis. The width of the container is the distance between the two pointers, and the height is the minimum of the heights at the two pointers.
-   Move Pointers: To potentially find a larger area, move the pointer that points to the shorter line inward, because moving the longer line inward won't increase the area (since the height is determined by the shorter line).
-   Update Maximum Area: Keep track of the maximum area found during the iterations.
-   Repeat: Continue the process until the two pointers meet.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.size() - 1;
        int max_area = 0;
        
        while (left < right) {
            // Calculate the area with the current pair of lines
            int width = right - left;
            int current_height = min(height[left], height[right]);
            int current_area = width * current_height;
            
            // Update the maximum area found
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area);
            
            // Move the pointer that points to the shorter line
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return max_area;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** traverses the array once

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
