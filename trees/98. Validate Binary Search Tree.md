# [98. Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

### Approach Used :

-   BST Properties:
    -   For any node, all values in its left subtree must be less than the node's value.   
    -   All values in its right subtree must be greater than the node's value.
    -   Both the left and right subtrees must also be valid BSTs.
-   Approach:
    -   Recursive Validation: Use a helper function that takes a node and two bounds (min and max) as parameters.
        -   For each node, check if its value is within the bounds. If not, it's not a valid BST.
        -   Recursively validate the left and right subtrees with updated bounds.
    -   Initial Bounds: Start with the entire range of valid values, typically INT_MIN to INT_MAX.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        return isValidBSTHelper(root, LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX);
    }
    
private:
    bool isValidBSTHelper(TreeNode* node, long min, long max) {
        if (!node) return true; // An empty node is a valid BST
        
        if (node->val <= min || node->val >= max) {
            return false; // Current node's value is out of the valid range
        }
        
        // Recursively validate the left and right subtrees with updated bounds
        return isValidBSTHelper(node->left, min, node->val) &&
               isValidBSTHelper(node->right, node->val, max);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N):** where N is the number of nodes. Each node is visited exactly once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(H):** where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case of a skewed tree, this can be O(N).
