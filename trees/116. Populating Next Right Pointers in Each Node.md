# [116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

### Approach Used :

-   Level-order Traversal: 
    -   Use a breadth-first traversal with a queue to process each level of the tree.
    -   For each level, connect the nodes in the next pointers.
-   Iterative Connection:
    -   Use a queue to keep track of nodes at the current level.
    -   Once you process all nodes at the current level, connect each node's next pointer to the node that follows it in the same level.

-   Detailed Steps:
    -   Initialize: Start by initializing the queue with the root node.
    -   Process Each Level: For each node, connect it to the next node in the queue (i.e., the node that comes immediately after it on the same level).
    -   Move to Next Level: Once all nodes of the current level are processed, move to the next level by adding all children of the current level nodes to the queue.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node* next;

    Node() : val(0), left(NULL), right(NULL), next(NULL) {}

    Node(int _val) : val(_val), left(NULL), right(NULL), next(NULL) {}

    Node(int _val, Node* _left, Node* _right, Node* _next)
        : val(_val), left(_left), right(_right), next(_next) {}
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    Node* connect(Node* root) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;

        std::queue<Node*> q;
        q.push(root);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            Node* prev = nullptr;

            // Process all nodes at the current level
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                Node* node = q.front();
                q.pop();

                // Connect the previous node's next pointer
                if (prev) {
                    prev->next = node;
                }
                prev = node;

                // Add the children of the current node to the queue
                if (node->left) {
                    q.push(node->left);
                }
                if (node->right) {
                    q.push(node->right);
                }
            }

            // The last node in the level points to NULL
            if (prev) {
                prev->next = nullptr;
            }
        }

        return root;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):**  Each node is processed exactly once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(W):** where W is the maximum width of the tree. In a perfect binary tree, this is O(N) in the worst case when all nodes are at the same level.
