# [662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-of-binary-tree/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree.

The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.

It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

### Approach Used :

-   Breadth-First Search (BFS):
    -   Traverse the tree level by level using a queue.
    -   For each node, calculate its position within the tree assuming the root is at position 1. For any node at position i, its left child is at position 2*i and its right child is at position 2*i + 1.
-   Track the Width:
    -   For each level, determine the width by calculating the difference between the positions of the leftmost and rightmost nodes.
    -   Update the maximum width accordingly.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int widthOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        
        // Queue to store nodes along with their index
        std::queue<std::pair<TreeNode*, unsigned long long>> q;
        q.push({root, 1});
        int maxWidth = 0;
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            unsigned long long minIndex = q.front().second;  // Start of the level
            unsigned long long first, last;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front().first;
                unsigned long long curIndex = q.front().second - minIndex;  // Normalize index to avoid overflow
                q.pop();
                
                if (i == 0) first = curIndex;
                if (i == size - 1) last = curIndex;
                
                if (node->left) {
                    q.push({node->left, 2 * curIndex});
                }
                if (node->right) {
                    q.push({node->right, 2 * curIndex + 1});
                }
            }
            
            maxWidth = std::max(maxWidth, static_cast<int>(last - first + 1));
        }
        
        return maxWidth;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** We visit each node exactly once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** for the queue used in BFS, which in the worst case can hold all the nodes at the deepest level of the tree.
