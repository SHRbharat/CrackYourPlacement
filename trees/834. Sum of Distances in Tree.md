# [834. Sum of Distances in Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-distances-in-tree/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

There is an undirected connected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.

You are given the integer n and the array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

Return an array answer of length n where answer[i] is the sum of the distances between the ith node in the tree and all other nodes.

### Approach Used :

-   Tree Representation:
    -   Represent the tree using an adjacency list. This helps in efficiently traversing the tree.
-   Two Pass DFS:
    -   First DFS Pass:
        -   Compute the size of each subtree and the initial distance sums for each node.
        -   The size of a subtree rooted at a node is the number of nodes in that subtree.
        -   The distance sum from the root to all other nodes is calculated during this traversal.
    -   Second DFS Pass:
        -   Using the results from the first DFS, compute the distance sums for all nodes based on their parent’s distance sum.
        -   Update each node’s distance sum using the distance sum of its parent.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sumOfDistancesInTree(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
        vector<int> subtreeSize(n, 0);
        vector<int> distanceSum(n, 0);
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        
        // Build the graph (adjacency list)
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
            graph[u].push_back(v);
            graph[v].push_back(u);
        }

        // First DFS to calculate subtree sizes and distance sums
        function<void(int, int)> dfs1 = [&](int node, int parent) {
            subtreeSize[node] = 1;
            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                if (neighbor == parent) continue;
                dfs1(neighbor, node);
                subtreeSize[node] += subtreeSize[neighbor];
                distanceSum[node] += distanceSum[neighbor] + subtreeSize[neighbor];
            }
        };

        // Second DFS to calculate distance sums for all nodes
        function<void(int, int)> dfs2 = [&](int node, int parent) {
            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                if (neighbor == parent) continue;
                distanceSum[neighbor] = distanceSum[node] - subtreeSize[neighbor] + (n - subtreeSize[neighbor]);
                dfs2(neighbor, node);
            }
        };

        // Start DFS from node 0 (or any node)
        dfs1(0, -1);
        dfs2(0, -1);

        return distanceSum;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** Each node and edge is visited exactly twice, resulting in linear time complexity.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** The space complexity is dominated by the storage for the adjacency list and auxiliary arrays.
