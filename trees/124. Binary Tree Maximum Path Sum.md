# [124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

### Approach Used :

-   Recursive Function:
    -   Define a recursive function that returns the maximum path sum starting from a given node and extending downwards. This function will help in computing the potential maximum path sum for any node.
-   Path Sum Calculation:
    -   For each node, calculate:
        -   The maximum sum of paths extending through the left subtree.
        -   The maximum sum of paths extending through the right subtree.
        -   The maximum path sum including the node itself and both subtrees.
    -   Update the global maximum path sum using the computed value.
-   Base Case:
    -   If a node is nullptr, return 0 (i.e., no contribution to the path sum).

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int globalMax = INT_MIN;  // This will hold the maximum path sum found
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        // Start the recursion with the root node
        helper(root);
        return globalMax;
    }
    // Helper function to compute the maximum path sum starting from the given node
        int helper(TreeNode* node) {
            if (!node) return 0;

            // Recursively get the maximum path sum for left and right subtrees
            int leftMax = max(helper(node->left), 0);
            int rightMax = max(helper(node->right), 0);

            // Calculate the maximum path sum that passes through this node
            int currentMax = node->val + leftMax + rightMax;

            // Update the global maximum path sum
            globalMax = max(globalMax, currentMax);

            // Return the maximum path sum extending downwards from this node
            return node->val + max(leftMax, rightMax);
        }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** Each node is visited exactly once during the traversal of the tree.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(h):** The space complexity is determined by the height of the tree h due to the recursion stack.
