# [968. Binary Tree Cameras](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

### Approach Used :

-   Define States:
    -   State 0: Node is not covered and has no camera.
    -   State 1: Node has a camera.
    -   State 2: Node is covered by a camera but does not have one itself.
-   DFS Traversal:
    -   Traverse the tree using DFS and determine the state of each node based on its children.
    -   Decide whether to place a camera at a node based on whether its children are covered or not.
-   Post-Order Traversal:
    -   Perform a post-order traversal to ensure that the children nodes are processed before their parent nodes.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCameraCover(TreeNode* root) {
        int cameras = 0;
        // Check if the root needs a camera, returns the state
        if (dfs(root, cameras) == 0) {
            cameras++;
        }
        return cameras;
    }
    
    // Returns the state of the current node
    // 0: No camera, not covered
    // 1: Camera installed
    // 2: Covered by camera
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, int& cameras) {
        if (!node) return 2; // Null nodes are covered by default

        int left = dfs(node->left, cameras);
        int right = dfs(node->right, cameras);

        if (left == 0 || right == 0) {
            // If either child is not covered, place a camera at this node
            cameras++;
            return 1; // Node has a camera
        }
        if (left == 1 || right == 1) {
            // If either child has a camera, this node is covered
            return 2; // Node is covered by a camera
        }
        // If both children are covered but have no cameras, this node is not covered
        return 0;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** Each node is visited exactly once during the DFS traversal

### Space Complexity:
- **O(h):** The space complexity is determined by the recursion stack.
