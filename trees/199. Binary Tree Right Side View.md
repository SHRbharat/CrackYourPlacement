# [199. Binary Tree Right Side View](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

### Approach Used :

-   Level-Order Traversal (BFS):
    -   Perform a BFS traversal using a queue. At each level, track the last node (rightmost node) encountered.
    -   The rightmost node of each level will be visible from the right side.
-   Queue for BFS: Use a queue to keep track of nodes and their corresponding level. Initialize the queue with the root node and its level.
-   Track Rightmost Node: For each level, iterate through all nodes, and the last node processed for that level will be the rightmost node.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> rightSideView(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> result;
        if (!root) return result;
        
        queue<pair<TreeNode*, int>> q;  // queue to hold nodes and their level
        q.push({root, 0});
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int levelSize = q.size();
            int rightmostValue;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
                auto [node, level] = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                // Update the rightmost value of this level
                rightmostValue = node->val;
                
                // Add child nodes to the queue
                if (node->left) q.push({node->left, level + 1});
                if (node->right) q.push({node->right, level + 1});
            }
            
            // After processing all nodes at this level, add the rightmost node value to the result
            result.push_back(rightmostValue);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N):** where N is the number of nodes. Each node is processed exactly once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(W):** where W is the maximum width of the tree. The space complexity mainly comes from the queue used for BFS.
