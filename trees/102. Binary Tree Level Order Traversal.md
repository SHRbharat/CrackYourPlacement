# [102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

### Approach Used :

-   Initialize a Queue: Use a queue to keep track of nodes and their levels as you traverse the tree.
-   Process Each Level: For each level, iterate through all nodes at that level, and collect their values.
-   Enqueue Children: Enqueue the left and right children of each node as you process them, keeping track of their levels.
-   Store Results: Store the values of nodes for each level in a result list, which will be a list of lists.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        if (!root) return result; // If the tree is empty, return an empty list
        
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int levelSize = q.size();
            vector<int> currentLevel;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                currentLevel.push_back(node->val);
                
                if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
            }
            
            result.push_back(currentLevel);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N):** where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed exactly once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(W):** where W is the maximum width of the tree. The space complexity is primarily due to the queue used in BFS.
