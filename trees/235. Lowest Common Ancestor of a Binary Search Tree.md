# [235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

### Approach Used :

-   To find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) in a Binary Search Tree (BST), we can utilize the property that for any node N in a BST, all nodes in the left subtree of N have values less than N's value, and all nodes in the right subtree have values greater than N's value.

-   Given this, we can determine the LCA by comparing the values of p and q with the current node.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        while (root != nullptr) {
            // If both p and q are greater than root, then LCA lies in the right subtree.
            if (p->val > root->val && q->val > root->val) {
                root = root->right;
            }
            // If both p and q are smaller than root, then LCA lies in the left subtree.
            else if (p->val < root->val && q->val < root->val) {
                root = root->left;
            }
            // If root is between p and q, or root is p or q itself, then root is the LCA.
            else {
                return root;
            }
        }
        return nullptr; // In case there's no LCA, which shouldn't happen in a valid BST with p and q present.
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(h):** where h is the height of the BST. In the worst case, h could be O(n) for a skewed tree, but in a balanced BST, it is O(log n).

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
