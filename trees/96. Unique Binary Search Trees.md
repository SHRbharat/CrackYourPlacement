# [96. Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given an integer n, return the number of structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) which has exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n.

### Approach Used :

-   To find the number of structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BSTs) that can be formed with n nodes, where nodes have unique values from 1 to n, you can use a combinatorial approach based on dynamic programming. This is known as the Catalan number problem.

-   Catalan Numbers:
    -   The number of unique BSTs that can be formed with n nodes is given by the nth Catalan number. The Catalan number can be computed using dynamic programming.

-   Dynamic Programming Approach:
    -   Define dp[i] as the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with i nodes.
    -   Initialize dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = 1 because there is only one way to form an empty tree or a single-node tree.

-   Recurrence Relation:
    -   For each number of nodes i, the number of unique BSTs can be computed by choosing each node as the root and counting the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with the remaining nodes:
    -   dp[i]= <sup>i</sup>∑<sub>(j=1)</sub> (dp[j−1]×dp[i−j])
    -   Here, j-1 represents the number of nodes in the left subtree and i-j represents the number of nodes in the right subtree.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1; // Base case: There's one empty tree
        
        // Fill the dp array using the recurrence relation
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {
                dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2):** as we use a nested loop to compute the number of unique BSTs.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** due to the space needed for the dp array.
