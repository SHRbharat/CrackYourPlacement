# [297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

### Approach Used :

-   Serialization:
    -   Perform a pre-order traversal of the binary tree and record each node's value.
    -   Use a placeholder for NULL nodes to ensure the tree structure is preserved during deserialization.
-   Deserialization:
    -   Use the recorded node values to reconstruct the binary tree.
    -   Use a queue to process the serialized values and reconstruct the tree in the correct order.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Codec {
public:
    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    string serialize(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return "#";
        
        stringstream ss;
        preOrder(root, ss);
        return ss.str();
    }
    
    // Helper function for pre-order traversal.
    void preOrder(TreeNode* node, stringstream& ss) {
        if (!node) {
            ss << "# ";
            return;
        }
        ss << node->val << " ";
        preOrder(node->left, ss);
        preOrder(node->right, ss);
    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    TreeNode* deserialize(string data) {
        stringstream ss(data);
        return buildTree(ss);
    }
    
    // Helper function to build tree from stringstream.
    TreeNode* buildTree(stringstream& ss) {
        string val;
        ss >> val;
        if (val == "#") return NULL;

        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(stoi(val));
        node->left = buildTree(ss);
        node->right = buildTree(ss);
        return node;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** Both operations involve visiting each node exactly once

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** space required for storing the serialized string and space used by the tree nodes and the string stream.
