# [987. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/vertical-order-traversal-of-a-binary-tree/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

Given the root of a binary tree, calculate the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.

For each node at position (row, col), its left and right children will be at positions (row + 1, col - 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) respectively. The root of the tree is at (0, 0).

The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.

Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.

### Approach Used :

-   Traversal with Position Tracking:
    -   Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the tree while keeping track of each nodeâ€™s position in terms of column and row indices.
    -   For BFS, use a queue to maintain nodes along with their column and row positions.
-   Column-Based Sorting:
    -   Use a map to store nodes by their column index. Each entry in the map will contain a list of nodes for that column.
    -   Within each column, sort nodes first by row index and then by their values to ensure correct vertical ordering.
-   Result Construction:
    -   Extract the nodes from the map, sorted by column index, and construct the final result list.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> verticalTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        // Map to store nodes by column index
        map<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> nodes;

        // BFS queue (node, row, column)
        queue<tuple<TreeNode*, int, int>> q;
        q.push({root, 0, 0});

        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [node, row, col] = q.front();
            q.pop();

            if (node) {
                nodes[col].push_back({row, node->val});
                q.push({node->left, row + 1, col - 1});
                q.push({node->right, row + 1, col + 1});
            }
        }

        // Prepare the result
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        for (auto &[col, vec] : nodes) {
            // Sort by row and then by value
            sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
            vector<int> colNodes;
            for (auto &[row, value] : vec) {
                colNodes.push_back(value);
            }
            result.push_back(colNodes);
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(nlogn):** The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** Space complexity is determined by the space needed to store the nodes and their positions in the map and the queue.
