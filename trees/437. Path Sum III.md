# [437. Path Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals targetSum.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

### Approach Used :

-   DFS Traversal: Traverse the tree using DFS. At each node, attempt to find all paths that sum up to the target value starting from that node.
-   Prefix Sum Technique: Use a hash map (or unordered_map) to store the cumulative sums from the root to the current node. This helps in finding the number of valid paths efficiently.
-   Helper Function: Define a helper function that recursively traverses the tree while maintaining a running sum and updates the count of paths that sum to the target value.

-   Steps:
-   Define a Recursive Function:
    -   This function will traverse the tree while keeping track of the current path sum.
    -   Check if the current path sum minus the target sum has been seen before (using a hash map).
    -   Update the hash map with the current path sum.
-   Invoke the Recursive Function:
    -   For each node, invoke the recursive function to count paths starting from that node.
    -   Recursively process the left and right children of the node.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int pathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        // Hash map to store the count of prefix sums
        unordered_map<long long, int> prefixSumCount;
        prefixSumCount[0] = 1; // Base case: to account for paths that exactly equal to targetSum
        
        return dfs(root, targetSum, 0, prefixSumCount);
    }
    
private:
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, int targetSum, long long currentSum, unordered_map<long long, int>& prefixSumCount) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        
        // Update the current path sum
        currentSum += node->val;
        int count = 0;
        
        // Check if there is a path that ends at the current node with sum equals to targetSum
        if (prefixSumCount.find(currentSum - targetSum) != prefixSumCount.end()) {
            count = prefixSumCount[currentSum - targetSum];
        }
        
        // Update the prefix sum count for the current path sum
        prefixSumCount[currentSum]++;
        
        // Recursively count paths in the left and right subtree
        count += dfs(node->left, targetSum, currentSum, prefixSumCount);
        count += dfs(node->right, targetSum, currentSum, prefixSumCount);
        
        // Restore the prefix sum count for the current path sum before going back up the tree
        prefixSumCount[currentSum]--;
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N):** where N is the number of nodes. Each node is visited once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(H):** where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack and the hash map storing prefix sums.
