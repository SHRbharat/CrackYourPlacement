# [934. Shortest Bridge](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-bridge/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

You are given an n x n binary matrix grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1's not connected to any other 1's. There are exactly two islands in grid.

You may change 0's to 1's to connect the two islands to form one island.

Return the smallest number of 0's you must flip to connect the two islands.

### Approach Used :

-   Identify the Two Islands:
    -   Traverse the matrix to find one of the islands.
    -   Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to mark all the 1s of that island and add them to a queue for further processing.
-   Expand the Island:
    -   Using BFS, start expanding from the perimeter of the first island by flipping 0s to 1s until the second island is reached. The BFS ensures that we find the shortest path (minimum flips) between the two islands.
-   Return the Result:
    -   The number of layers expanded in BFS before reaching the second island gives the minimum number of 0 flips required to connect the two islands.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Directions for moving in 4 directions (up, down, left, right)
    vector<int> directionX = {0, 0, 1, -1};
    vector<int> directionY = {1, -1, 0, 0};

    void dfs(int x, int y, vector<vector<int>>& grid, queue<pair<int, int>>& q) {
        int n = grid.size();
        // Mark the current cell as part of the island (visited)
        grid[x][y] = 2;
        q.push({x, y}); // Add the cell to the queue for BFS expansion
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int newX = x + directionX[i];
            int newY = y + directionY[i];
            // Check if the new cell is within bounds and part of the island
            if (newX >= 0 && newX < n && newY >= 0 && newY < n && grid[newX][newY] == 1) {
                dfs(newX, newY, grid, q);
            }
        }
    }

    int shortestBridge(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        bool found = false;

        // Step 1: Use DFS to find the first island and mark all its cells
        for (int i = 0; i < n && !found; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n && !found; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    dfs(i, j, grid, q);
                    found = true;
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Use BFS to expand the first island and find the shortest path to the second island
        int steps = 0;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            while (size--) {
                auto [x, y] = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                    int newX = x + directionX[i];
                    int newY = y + directionY[i];
                    
                    if (newX >= 0 && newX < n && newY >= 0 && newY < n) {
                        if (grid[newX][newY] == 1) {
                            return steps; // Reached the second island
                        }
                        if (grid[newX][newY] == 0) {
                            grid[newX][newY] = 2; // Mark as visited
                            q.push({newX, newY});
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            steps++;
        }
        
        return -1; // This should never be reached if the input is valid
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2):**  where n is the dimension of the grid. This is because we might have to visit each cell in the worst case.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n^2):** for storing the queue and visited cells.
