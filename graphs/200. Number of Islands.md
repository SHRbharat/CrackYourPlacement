# [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

### Approach Used :

-   Use DFS to explore the entire connected component of '1's when one is found.
-   Change '1' to '0' to mark it as visited, ensuring we don't count the same island more than once.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {
        // Check if the current cell is out of bounds or is water
        if (i < 0 || i >= grid.size() || j < 0 || j >= grid[0].size() || grid[i][j] == '0') {
            return;
        }

        // Mark the current cell as visited
        grid[i][j] = '0';

        // Traverse all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
    }

    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        if (grid.empty()) return 0;

        int numIslands = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    ++numIslands;
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                }
            }
        }

        return numIslands;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n):** where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. Every cell is visited once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(m * n):** in the worst case for the call stack in DFS, where the grid is completely filled with land.
