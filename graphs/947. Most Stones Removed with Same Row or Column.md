# [947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-stones-removed-with-same-row-or-column/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.

### Approach Used :

-   Graph Representation:
    -   Each stone is a node.
    -   An edge exists between two nodes if they are in the same row or column.
-   Connected Components:
    -   For each stone, use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) to find all stones in its connected component.
-   Result:
    -   The number of stones that can be removed is n - number of connected components.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(int i, vector<vector<int>>& stones, vector<bool>& visited) {
        visited[i] = true;
        for (int j = 0; j < stones.size(); j++) {
            if (!visited[j] && (stones[i][0] == stones[j][0] || stones[i][1] == stones[j][1])) {
                dfs(j, stones, visited);
            }
        }
    }
    
    int removeStones(vector<vector<int>>& stones) {
        int n = stones.size();
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        int numOfComponents = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfs(i, stones, visited);
                numOfComponents++;
            }
        }
        
        return n - numOfComponents;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2):** in the worst case because for each stone, we might have to check every other stone (i.e., O(n) for each of the n stones).

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** for the visited array and the recursive stack in the DFS.
