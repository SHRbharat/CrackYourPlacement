# [546. Remove Boxes](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-boxes/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

You are given several boxes with different colors represented by different positive numbers.

You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there is no box left. Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color (i.e., composed of k boxes, k >= 1), remove them and get k * k points.

Return the maximum points you can get.

### Approach Used :

-   This approach leverages a 3D DP table mem[i][j][k] to store the maximum points that can be obtained from the subarray boxes[i..j] if there are k boxes adjacent and equal to boxes[j].
-   Recursive Breakdown:
    -   The base case is when i > j, which means there are no boxes to remove, so the score is 0.
    -   Start from the rightmost position j and calculate how many contiguous boxes (including k additional boxes) are equal to boxes[j].
    -   Recursively compute the maximum score by considering two possibilities:
-   -   Remove the contiguous segment of boxes ending at j and calculate the score.
    -   Try to merge non-contiguous segments of the same color to increase the score by removing the segment ending at r first, then addressing the segment ending before r.
    -   This method ensures that overlapping subproblems are efficiently solved using memoization.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int removeBoxes(vector<int>& boxes) {
    const int n = boxes.size();
    vector<vector<vector<int>>> mem(n, vector<vector<int>>(n, vector<int>(n)));
    return removeBoxes(boxes, 0, n - 1, 0, mem);
  }

 private:
  // Returns the maximum score of boxes[i..j] if k boxes eqaul to boxes[j].
  int removeBoxes(const vector<int>& boxes, int i, int j, int k,
                  vector<vector<vector<int>>>& mem) {
    if (i > j)
      return 0;
    if (mem[i][j][k] > 0)
      return mem[i][j][k];

    int r = j;
    int sameBoxes = k + 1;
    while (r > 0 && boxes[r - 1] == boxes[r]) {
      --r;
      ++sameBoxes;
    }
    mem[i][j][k] = removeBoxes(boxes, i, r - 1, 0, mem) + sameBoxes * sameBoxes;

    for (int p = i; p < r; ++p)
      if (boxes[p] == boxes[r])
        mem[i][j][k] =
            max(mem[i][j][k], removeBoxes(boxes, i, p, sameBoxes, mem) +
                                  removeBoxes(boxes, p + 1, r - 1, 0, mem));

    return mem[i][j][k];
  }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n<sup>4</sup>):** The complexity arises from the nested loops and recursive exploration of all subproblems.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n<sup>3</sup>):** due to the 3D DP table.
