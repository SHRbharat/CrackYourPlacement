# [399. Evaluate Division](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values, where equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i]. Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the jth query where you must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.

Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

Note: The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.

### Approach Used :

-   Graph Construction:
    -   Construct a graph where each variable is a node.
    -   For each equation Ai / Bi = value, add a directed edge from Ai to Bi with weight value, and another edge from Bi to Ai with weight 1 / value.
Graph Traversal:
    -   To evaluate each query Cj / Dj, perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from Cj and trying to reach Dj.
    -   If there exists a path from Cj to Dj, multiply the weights along the path to get the result.
    -   If no such path exists, return -1.0.
Edge Cases:
    -   If either Cj or Dj does not exist in the graph, return -1.0.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<double> calcEquation(vector<vector<string>>& equations, vector<double>& values, vector<vector<string>>& queries) {
        unordered_map<string, unordered_map<string, double>> graph;
        
        // Step 1: Build the graph
        for (int i = 0; i < equations.size(); ++i) {
            string u = equations[i][0];
            string v = equations[i][1];
            double value = values[i];
            graph[u][v] = value;
            graph[v][u] = 1.0 / value;
        }
        
        vector<double> results;
        
        // Step 2: Answer each query
        for (const auto& query : queries) {
            string start = query[0];
            string end = query[1];
            if (graph.find(start) == graph.end() || graph.find(end) == graph.end()) {
                results.push_back(-1.0);
            } else {
                unordered_map<string, bool> visited;
                double result = dfs(graph, start, end, 1.0, visited);
                results.push_back(result);
            }
        }
        
        return results;
    }

private:
    double dfs(unordered_map<string, unordered_map<string, double>>& graph, string current, string target, double value, unordered_map<string, bool>& visited) {
        if (current == target) return value;
        visited[current] = true;
        
        for (const auto& neighbor : graph[current]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor.first]) {
                double result = dfs(graph, neighbor.first, target, value * neighbor.second, visited);
                if (result != -1.0) return result;
            }
        }
        
        return -1.0;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(Q * (V + E)):** where Q is the number of queries, V is the number of unique variables, and E is the number of equations. For each query, we may need to visit all vertices and edges.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(V + E):** for storing the graph and the visited nodes.
