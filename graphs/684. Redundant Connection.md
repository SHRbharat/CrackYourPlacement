# [684. Redundant Connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

### Approach Used :

-   Union-Find Structure:
    -   Parent Array: This keeps track of the parent of each node.
    -   Rank Array (optional but useful): This is used to keep the tree flat by ensuring the smaller tree is always attached to the root of the larger tree during the union operation.
-   Algorithm:
    -   For each edge, check if the two nodes are already connected (i.e., they have the same root). If they are, this edge is redundant.
    -   If they are not connected, perform a union operation to connect them.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int find(int x, vector<int>& parent) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x], parent); // Path compression
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    void unionSets(int x, int y, vector<int>& parent, vector<int>& rank) {
        int rootX = find(x, parent);
        int rootY = find(y, parent);

        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }

    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size();
        vector<int> parent(n + 1), rank(n + 1, 0);

        // Initialize each node to be its own parent
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }

        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
            if (find(u, parent) == find(v, parent)) {
                return edge;
            }
            unionSets(u, v, parent, rank);
        }

        return {};
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n * α(n)):** where α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, which is very slow-growing and can be considered almost constant in practice.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** for storing the parent and rank arrays.
