# [1162. As Far from Land as Possible](https://leetcode.com/problems/as-far-from-land-as-possible/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given an n x n grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return the distance. If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.

### Approach Used :

-   Multi-source BFS:
    -   Start a BFS from all land cells simultaneously. Each land cell is treated as a starting point (i.e., the 0th layer).
    -   As we perform the BFS, we propagate outwards from all land cells, marking the distance for each water cell as we reach it.
    -   The BFS ensures that the first time a water cell is reached, it's done so with the shortest possible distance from any land cell.
-   Edge Cases:
    -   If the grid contains only water or only land, return -1 since there is no valid cell that can satisfy the condition.
-   Result:
    -   The answer will be the maximum distance found during the BFS traversal.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistance(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        vector<vector<int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
        
        // Push all land cells into the queue
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    q.push({i, j});
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If there's no water or no land, return -1
        if (q.size() == 0 || q.size() == n * n) return -1;
        
        int distance = -1;
        
        // BFS from all land cells
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            distance++;
            while (size--) {
                auto [x, y] = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                for (auto& dir : directions) {
                    int nx = x + dir[0];
                    int ny = y + dir[1];
                    
                    // Check if it's within bounds and is water
                    if (nx >= 0 && nx < n && ny >= 0 && ny < n && grid[nx][ny] == 0) {
                        grid[nx][ny] = 1; // Mark it as visited by turning it into land
                        q.push({nx, ny});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return distance;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2):** since we process each cell once during BFS.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n^2):** due to the queue and the grid itself.
