# [1334. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

There are n cities numbered from 0 to n-1. Given the array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities fromi and toi, and given the integer distanceThreshold.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is at most distanceThreshold, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities i and j is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.

### Approach Used (floydd-warshall algo) :

-   Initialization:
    -   ans: Stores the city index with the smallest number of reachable cities within the threshold.
    -   minCitiesCount: Initialized to n (the total number of cities), it tracks the minimum number of reachable cities found so far.
    -   dist: A 2D vector that stores the shortest path distances between all pairs of cities.
-   Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:
    -   Distance Matrix Initialization: The distance between any two different cities is initially set to distanceThreshold + 1 (effectively infinity), and the distance from a city to itself is set to 0.
    -   Edge Weights: For each edge, the direct distance between the connected cities is updated.
    -   Shortest Path Calculation: The algorithm iteratively updates the distance matrix using the formula:
        *dist[i][j]=min(dist[i][j],dist[i][k]+dist[k][j])*
    This considers whether a shorter path exists via an intermediate city k.
-   Finding the Target City:
    -   The function iterates over each city i and counts how many cities j are reachable within the distanceThreshold using the computed shortest path distances.
    -   If the count of reachable cities for the current city is smaller than or equal to minCitiesCount, ans is updated to the current city index, and minCitiesCount is updated.
Return Result:
    -   Finally, the city index stored in ans is returned as the city with the smallest number of reachable cities within the given distance threshold.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int findTheCity(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int distanceThreshold) {
    int ans = -1;
    int minCitiesCount = n;
    const vector<vector<int>> dist = floydWarshall(n, edges, distanceThreshold);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      int citiesCount = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
        if (dist[i][j] <= distanceThreshold)
          ++citiesCount;
      if (citiesCount <= minCitiesCount) {
        ans = i;
        minCitiesCount = citiesCount;
      }
    }

    return ans;
  }

 private:
  vector<vector<int>> floydWarshall(int n, const vector<vector<int>>& edges,
                                    int distanceThreshold) {
    vector<vector<int>> dist(n, vector<int>(n, distanceThreshold + 1));

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      dist[i][i] = 0;

    for (const vector<int>& edge : edges) {
      const int u = edge[0];
      const int v = edge[1];
      const int w = edge[2];
      dist[u][v] = w;
      dist[v][u] = w;
    }

    for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k)
      for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
          dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]);

    return dist;
  }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^3):** due to the triple nested loop in the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n^2):** to store the distance matrix.
