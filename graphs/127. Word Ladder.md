# [127. Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

### Approach Used :

-   Graph Representation:
    -   Each word in the word list represents a node.
    -   An edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding words differ by exactly one letter.
-   BFS Traversal:
    -   Start from beginWord and explore all possible transformations level by level.
    -   Use a queue to manage the BFS, where each element contains the current word and the current length of the transformation sequence.
-   Early Termination:
    -   If during the BFS traversal we find endWord, we return the current transformation length as it represents the shortest path.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {
        unordered_set<string> wordSet(wordList.begin(), wordList.end());
        if (wordSet.find(endWord) == wordSet.end())
            return 0;

        queue<pair<string, int>> q;
        q.push({beginWord, 1});

        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [word, length] = q.front();
            q.pop();

            for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); ++i) {
                string original = word;

                // Try changing each letter in the word
                for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
                    word[i] = c;

                    // If the transformed word is in the word list
                    if (word == endWord)
                        return length + 1;

                    if (wordSet.find(word) != wordSet.end()) {
                        q.push({word, length + 1});
                        wordSet.erase(word);  // Mark word as visited
                    }
                }
                word = original;  // Revert to the original word before the next iteration
            }
        }

        return 0;  // If no transformation sequence is possible
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(M<sup>2</sup> * N):** where M is the length of each word and N is the total number of words in the word list. The M^2 factor comes from trying all possible single-letter transformations and checking the presence in the set.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(M * N):** for storing the word list in an unordered set and the BFS queue.
