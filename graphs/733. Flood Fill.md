# [733. Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Easy/green)

An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.

Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

### Approach Used :

-   Check if the starting pixel's color is the same as the target color. If it is, no change is needed, so we can directly return the image.
-   Use DFS to traverse 4-directionally from the starting pixel (sr, sc), checking whether each adjacent pixel has the same original color.
-   Recursively apply DFS to the neighboring pixels if they have the same color, replacing their color with the new color.
-   Return the modified image once all connected pixels have been filled.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Helper function to perform DFS for flood fill.
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& image, int sr, int sc, int color, int originalColor) {
        // Base case: if the current pixel is out of bounds or is not the original color, return.
        if (sr < 0 || sr >= image.size() || sc < 0 || sc >= image[0].size() || image[sr][sc] != originalColor) {
            return;
        }
        
        // Change the color of the current pixel.
        image[sr][sc] = color;
        
        // Perform DFS in 4 directions: up, down, left, right.
        dfs(image, sr + 1, sc, color, originalColor); // down
        dfs(image, sr - 1, sc, color, originalColor); // up
        dfs(image, sr, sc + 1, color, originalColor); // right
        dfs(image, sr, sc - 1, color, originalColor); // left
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> floodFill(vector<vector<int>>& image, int sr, int sc, int color) {
        int originalColor = image[sr][sc];
        
        // If the original color is the same as the new color, no need to change anything.
        if (originalColor != color) {
            // Start the DFS from the pixel (sr, sc).
            dfs(image, sr, sc, color, originalColor);
        }
        
        // Return the modified image.
        return image;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n):** where m and n are the dimensions of the image. In the worst case, we visit each pixel once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(m * n):** considering the recursion stack for DFS.
