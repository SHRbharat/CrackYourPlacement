# [802. Find Eventual Safe States](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].

A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

### Approach Used :

-   Construct a reverse graph where each edge points from a node to all nodes that originally pointed to it. Also, calculate the out-degree (number of outgoing edges) for each node in the original graph.
-   Identify all terminal nodes (nodes with zero out-degree) and add them to the queue.
-   Perform a BFS-like process: for each node in the queue, remove it from its neighbors' out-degree count. If any neighbor's out-degree becomes zero, it is safe and added to the queue.
-   The nodes processed in this manner are safe nodes. Sort the result array before returning it.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int n = graph.size();
        vector<vector<int>> reverseGraph(n);
        vector<int> outDegree(n, 0);
        queue<int> q;
        vector<int> result;

        // Step 1: Build the reverse graph and compute out-degrees
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int neighbor : graph[i]) {
                reverseGraph[neighbor].push_back(i);
            }
            outDegree[i] = graph[i].size();
        }

        // Step 2: Initialize the queue with terminal nodes
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (outDegree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Process the nodes with zero out-degree
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            result.push_back(node);

            for (int neighbor : reverseGraph[node]) {
                outDegree[neighbor]--;
                if (outDegree[neighbor] == 0) {
                    q.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Sort the result to ensure the answer is in ascending order
        sort(result.begin(), result.end());

        return result;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N + E):**  where N is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges. This is because each edge and node is processed once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(N + E):** for the reverse graph and additional structures like the queue and the out-degree array.
