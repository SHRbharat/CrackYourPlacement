# [1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-operations-to-make-network-connected/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

There are n computers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by ethernet cables connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between computers ai and bi. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.

You are given an initial computer network connections. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected.

Return the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected. If it is not possible, return -1.

### Approach Used :

-   First, check if the number of connections is less than n-1. If it is, it's impossible to connect all computers, so return -1.
-   Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.
-   Use DFS (Depth-First Search) to count the number of connected components in the graph.
-   The minimum number of operations required is equal to the number of connected components minus one (components - 1).

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(int node, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<bool>& visited) {
        visited[node] = true;
        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                dfs(neighbor, adj, visited);
            }
        }
    }

    int makeConnected(int n, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {
        if (connections.size() < n - 1) {
            return -1; // Not enough cables to connect all computers
        }

        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        for (auto& conn : connections) {
            adj[conn[0]].emplace_back(conn[1]);
            adj[conn[1]].emplace_back(conn[0]);
        }

        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        int components = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                components++;
                dfs(i, adj, visited);
            }
        }

        // Minimum number of operations to connect all components is (components - 1)
        return components - 1;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N + E):** where N is the number of computers and E is the number of connections.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(N + E):** for the adjacency list and the visited array.
