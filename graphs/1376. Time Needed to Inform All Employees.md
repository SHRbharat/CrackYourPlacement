# [1376. Time Needed to Inform All Employees](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-needed-to-inform-all-employees/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

A company has n employees with a unique ID for each employee from 0 to n - 1. The head of the company is the one with headID.

Each employee has one direct manager given in the manager array where manager[i] is the direct manager of the i-th employee, manager[headID] = -1. Also, it is guaranteed that the subordination relationships have a tree structure.

The head of the company wants to inform all the company employees of an urgent piece of news. He will inform his direct subordinates, and they will inform their subordinates, and so on until all employees know about the urgent news.

The i-th employee needs informTime[i] minutes to inform all of his direct subordinates (i.e., After informTime[i] minutes, all his direct subordinates can start spreading the news).

Return the number of minutes needed to inform all the employees about the urgent news.

### Approach Used :

-   To solve this problem, we can treat the company hierarchy as a tree, where each employee is a node, and edges represent the manager-subordinate relationships. The problem then reduces to finding the maximum time required to propagate the news from the head of the company (root of the tree) to all employees.

-   A Depth-First Search (DFS) approach can be used to traverse the tree and calculate the total time required to inform all employees.

-   Create an adjacency list to represent the hierarchy tree, where each manager points to their direct subordinates.
-   Implement a recursive DFS function to calculate the time taken to inform all employees under the current node. The DFS function will return the maximum time needed to inform all subordinates.
-   The time taken by the current employee is the time to inform all their subordinates plus their own informTime.
-   Initiate DFS from the headID and return the total time.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(int current, vector<vector<int>>& adjList, vector<int>& informTime) {
        int maxTime = 0;
        for (int subordinate : adjList[current]) {
            maxTime = max(maxTime, dfs(subordinate, adjList, informTime));
        }
        return informTime[current] + maxTime;
    }

    int numOfMinutes(int n, int headID, vector<int>& manager, vector<int>& informTime) {
        vector<vector<int>> adjList(n);
        
        // Build adjacency list
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (manager[i] != -1) {
                adjList[manager[i]].push_back(i);
            }
        }

        // Start DFS from headID
        return dfs(headID, adjList, informTime);
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N):**  where N is the number of employees. Each employee and edge is visited once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(N):** for the adjacency list and the recursion stack in the worst case.
