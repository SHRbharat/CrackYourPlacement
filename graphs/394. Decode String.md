# [394. Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there will not be input like 3a or 2[4].

The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed 105.

### Approach Used :

-   Use a Stack: We'll use a stack to store the current string being processed and the multiplier (k) whenever we encounter a '['.
-   Iterate through the String:
    -   If we encounter a digit, it represents the multiplier for the following encoded string.
    -   If we encounter [, we'll push the current processed string and the multiplier onto the stack, and then reset them to start processing the new encoded string.
    -   If we encounter ], it means we've reached the end of the current encoded string, so we'll pop from the stack and repeat the current decoded string by the multiplier before adding it to the previous string from the stack.
    -   If we encounter a letter, we'll simply add it to the current processed string.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string decodeString(string s) {
        stack<string> strStack;
        stack<int> numStack;
        string currentStr = "";
        int k = 0;

        for (char ch : s) {
            if (isdigit(ch)) {
                k = k * 10 + (ch - '0');
            } else if (ch == '[') {
                strStack.push(currentStr);
                numStack.push(k);
                currentStr = "";
                k = 0;
            } else if (ch == ']') {
                string decodedStr = strStack.top();
                strStack.pop();
                int repeatTimes = numStack.top();
                numStack.pop();
                
                for (int i = 0; i < repeatTimes; ++i) {
                    decodedStr += currentStr;
                }
                currentStr = decodedStr;
            } else {
                currentStr += ch;
            }
        }
        
        return currentStr;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** in the worst case, we store all characters in the stack.
