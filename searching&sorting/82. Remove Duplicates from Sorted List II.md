# [82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

### Approach Used :

-   Dummy Node:
    -   Start by creating a dummy node that points to the head of the list. This helps in handling edge cases, such as when the head itself needs to be deleted.
-   Two Pointers:
    -   Use two pointers, prev and curr.
    -   prev points to the last node before the sequence of duplicates.
    -   curr traverses the list to detect duplicates.
-   Skip Duplicates:
    -   While traversing the list, check if curr and curr->next have the same value.
    -   If they do, continue moving curr until you skip all nodes with this duplicate value.
    -   If duplicates were detected (i.e., prev->next is not equal to curr), link prev->next to the node after the last duplicate.
-   Move Pointers:
    -   If no duplicates are found, move prev to curr.
    -   Move curr to the next node.
-   Return the Modified List:
    -   The head of the new list is the next node of the dummy node.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head) return nullptr;
        
        // Dummy node
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
        ListNode* prev = dummy;
        
        while (head) {
            // Check if the current node is a start of duplicates
            if (head->next && head->val == head->next->val) {
                // Move head to the last node of duplicates
                while (head->next && head->val == head->next->val) {
                    head = head->next;
                }
                // Skip all duplicates
                prev->next = head->next;
            } else {
                // Move prev pointer forward if no duplicate is found
                prev = prev->next;
            }
            // Move head pointer forward
            head = head->next;
        }
        
        return dummy->next;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** each node is traversed once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
