# [86. Partition List](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

### Approach Used :

-   Two Pointers for Two Lists:
    -   Initialize two dummy nodes: lessHead for nodes with values less than x, and greaterHead for nodes with values greater than or equal to x.
    -   Use two pointers, less and greater, to build the two lists as you iterate through the original list.
-   Iterate Through the List:
    -   Traverse the original list node by node.
    -   For each node:
        -   If the node's value is less than x, append it to the less list.
        -   If the node's value is greater than or equal to x, append it to the greater list.
    -   Move the less and greater pointers accordingly.
-   Combine the Lists:

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* partition(ListNode* head, int x) {
        // Create two dummy nodes to start the less and greater lists
        ListNode* lessHead = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode* greaterHead = new ListNode(0);
        
        // Pointers to build the lists
        ListNode* less = lessHead;
        ListNode* greater = greaterHead;
        
        // Iterate through the list
        while (head) {
            if (head->val < x) {
                less->next = head;
                less = less->next;
            } else {
                greater->next = head;
                greater = greater->next;
            }
            head = head->next;
        }
        
        // Combine the two lists
        greater->next = nullptr; // End the greater list
        less->next = greaterHead->next; // Link the less list to the greater list
        
        // Return the start of the new list
        return lessHead->next;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** each node is traversed once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
