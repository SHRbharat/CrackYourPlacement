# [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

### Approach Used :

-   To solve the problem of removing the nth node from the end of a linked list, we can use the two-pointer technique. The idea is to have two pointers with a fixed gap of n nodes between them. By moving both pointers together, when the first pointer reaches the end, the second pointer will be just before the node we want to remove.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        // Create a dummy node that points to the head
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
        ListNode* fast = dummy;
        ListNode* slow = dummy;

        // Move fast n steps ahead
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            fast = fast->next;
        }

        // Move fast to the end, maintaining the gap
        while (fast->next != nullptr) {
            fast = fast->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }

        // Remove the nth node from the end
        slow->next = slow->next->next;

        // Return the new head of the list
        return dummy->next;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** each node is travesrsed once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
