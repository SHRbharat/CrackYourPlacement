# [23. Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

### Approach Used :

-   Initialize the Min-Heap:
    -   Push the head of each linked list into the heap.
-   Extract Minimum and Merge:
    -   Extract the smallest node from the heap.
    -   Add it to the merged list.
    -   If the extracted node has a next node, push that next node into the heap.
-   Return the Result 

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    struct compare {
        bool operator()(ListNode* a, ListNode* b) {
            return a->val > b->val;
        }
    };
    
    ListNode* mergeKLists(vector<ListNode*>& lists) {
        // Edge case: if the input is empty
        if (lists.empty()) return nullptr;
        
        // Min-heap (priority queue) to hold the nodes
        priority_queue<ListNode*, vector<ListNode*>, compare> minHeap;
        
        // Initialize the heap with the head of each list
        for (ListNode* list : lists) {
            if (list) {
                minHeap.push(list);
            }
        }
        
        // Dummy node to help with the merged list
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode* current = dummy;
        
        // Extract the smallest element from the heap and add it to the merged list
        while (!minHeap.empty()) {
            ListNode* smallest = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            current->next = smallest;
            current = current->next;
            
            // If the smallest node has a next node, push it into the heap
            if (smallest->next) {
                minHeap.push(smallest->next);
            }
        }
        
        return dummy->next;  // Return the merged list starting from the next of dummy
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(nlogk):** where N is the total number of nodes across all linked lists, and k is the number of linked lists. This is because each node insertion and extraction from the heap takes O(log k) time.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(k):**  for the heap, where k is the number of linked lists, as the heap holds at most one node from each list at any time.
