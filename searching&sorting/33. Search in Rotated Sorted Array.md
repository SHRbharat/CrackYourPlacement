# [33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

### Approach Used :

-   Identify the Sorted Half:
    -   Start with the usual binary search by finding the middle element.
    -   Determine which half of the array (left or right) is sorted by comparing the middle element to the start and end elements of the current search range.
    -   If the left half is sorted, check if the target lies within this half. If it does, narrow down the search to the left half. If not, search in the right half.
    -   If the right half is sorted, do the same check for the target and narrow down the search accordingly.
-   Binary Search Logic:
    -   If the middle element is the target, return its index.
    -   If the element at the start of the search range is less than or equal to the middle element, the left half is sorted.
    -   If the middle element is less than or equal to the end element, the right half is sorted.
    -   Based on the target's comparison with the boundary elements of the sorted half, adjust the search range to either left or right.
-   Repeat until the target is found or the search range is exhausted.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            // Check if the middle element is the target
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            }

            // Check if the left half is sorted
            if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
                // Target is in the left half
                if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                    right = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            // Right half is sorted
            else {
                // Target is in the right half
                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }

        return -1;  // Target not found
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(log n):** because we are halving the search range with each iteration of the binary search.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
