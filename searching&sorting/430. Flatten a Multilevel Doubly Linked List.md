# [430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

You are given a doubly linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer, a previous pointer, and an additional child pointer. This child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, also containing these special nodes. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure as shown in the example below.

Given the head of the first level of the list, flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. Let curr be a node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear after curr and before curr.next in the flattened list.

Return the head of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have all of their child pointers set to null.

### Approach Used :

-   Recursive Flattening:
    -   We start from the head of the list and traverse through each node.
    -   If we encounter a node with a child pointer, we recursively flatten the child list.
    -   Once the child list is flattened, we insert it between the current node and the next node in the main list.
    -   The last node of the child list should connect to the original next node of the current node.
    -   Finally, we continue traversing the main list.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* flatten(Node* head) {
        if (!head) return nullptr;
        
        Node* curr = head;
        
        while (curr) {
            if (curr->child) {
                // Save the next node
                Node* next = curr->next;
                
                // Recursively flatten the child list
                Node* child = flatten(curr->child);
                
                // Insert the flattened child list between curr and next
                curr->next = child;
                child->prev = curr;
                
                // Find the tail of the flattened child list
                Node* tail = child;
                while (tail->next) {
                    tail = tail->next;
                }
                
                // Connect the tail with next, if there is a next node
                tail->next = next;
                if (next) {
                    next->prev = tail;
                }
                
                // Set the child pointer to nullptr
                curr->child = nullptr;
            }
            
            // Move to the next node
            curr = curr->next;
        }
        
        return head;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** Each node is visited once, making the complexity linear in the total number of nodes.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(d):** where d is the maximum depth of the nested lists (due to the recursive call stack).
