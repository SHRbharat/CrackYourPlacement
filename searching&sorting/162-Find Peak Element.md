# [162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

### Approach Used :

-   we can use a binary search approach: recursively divide the array into halves, and at each step, move to the half where a higher neighbor exists (indicating a peak may be there). This works because if an element is smaller than its neighbor, then there must be a peak in the direction of that neighbor.


### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.size() - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }

        return left;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(logn):** binary search approach 

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
