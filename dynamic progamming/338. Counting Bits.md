# [338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Easy/green)

Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

### Approach Used :

-   Dynamic Programming Array:
    -   Use an array ans where ans[i] will store the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.
-   Initialization:
    -   Initialize ans[0] to 0 because the number 0 has no 1's in its binary representation.
-   Recurrence Relation:
    -   For each integer i from 1 to n, calculate the number of 1's using the relation:
        -   ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i & 1)
        -   Here, i >> 1 is i divided by 2 (removing the least significant bit).
        -   (i & 1) checks if the least significant bit of i is 1.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        // Initialize the result array with n + 1 elements all set to 0
        vector<int> ans(n + 1, 0);

        // Fill the array using the recurrence relation
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i & 1);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** The algorithm iterates through numbers from 1 to n once, performing constant-time operations for each number.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** due to dp array.
