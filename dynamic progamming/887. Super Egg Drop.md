# [887. Super Egg Drop](https://leetcode.com/problems/super-egg-drop/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

You are given k identical eggs and you have access to a building with n floors labeled from 1 to n.

You know that there exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= n such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break.

Each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.

Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.

### Approach Used :

-   Understanding the Problem:
    -   You have k eggs and n floors.
    -   The goal is to find the highest floor f such that an egg dropped from any floor above f will break, and from any floor f or below it will not break.
    -   The challenge is to minimize the worst-case number of moves to determine the value of f.
-   Dynamic Programming Approach:
    -   Let dp[k][n] represent the minimum number of moves required to find the critical floor with k eggs and n floors.
    -   The strategy involves making a decision at each floor and considering two possible outcomes:
        -   The egg breaks: You now have k-1 eggs and x-1 floors to test.
        -   The egg does not break: You still have k eggs and n-x floors to test.
    -   For each possible floor x, the worst-case scenario is considered, and the minimum number of moves is calculated accordingly.
-   Recursive Formula:
    -   The recursive formula is:
        dp[k][n]=1 + min<sub>1≤x≤n</sub> max(dp[k−1][x−1],dp[k][n−x])
    -   This represents the worst-case scenario across all possible floors, minimized over all possible initial drops.
-   Base Cases:
    -   If there is only one floor (n=1), you need exactly one move regardless of the number of eggs.
    -   If there is only one egg (k=1), the only strategy is a linear search from floor 1 to floor n.
-   Optimization:
    -   The direct implementation of the above formula results in high time complexity (O(k * n^2)), which is inefficient for large inputs.
    -   To optimize, observe that the problem has an inherent structure where we can leverage binary search over the floor index x to speed up the decision process, reducing the time complexity to O(k * n * log n).

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int superEggDrop(int k, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(k + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));

        // Base cases
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
            dp[i][0] = 0;  // 0 floors
            dp[i][1] = 1;  // 1 floor
        }
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            dp[1][j] = j;  // 1 egg
        }

        // Fill the DP table
        for (int i = 2; i <= k; ++i) {
            for (int j = 2; j <= n; ++j) {
                int left = 1, right = j, ans = j;
                while (left <= right) {
                    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
                    int breakCase = dp[i - 1][mid - 1]; // Egg breaks
                    int noBreakCase = dp[i][j - mid];   // Egg doesn't break

                    ans = min(ans, max(breakCase, noBreakCase) + 1);
                    if (breakCase > noBreakCase) {
                        right = mid - 1;
                    } else {
                        left = mid + 1;
                    }
                }
                dp[i][j] = ans;
            }
        }

        return dp[k][n];
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(k * n * log n):** due to the binary search over the floors.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(k * n):** for storing the DP table.
