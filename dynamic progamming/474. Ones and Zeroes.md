# [474. Ones and Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

You are given an array of binary strings strs and two integers m and n.

Return the size of the largest subset of strs such that there are at most m 0's and n 1's in the subset.

A set x is a subset of a set y if all elements of x are also elements of y.

### Approach Used :

-   Dynamic Programming (DP) Table:
    -   Use a 2D DP table dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum size of the subset that can be formed with i '0's and j '1's.
-   Initialization:
    -   Initialize a 2D DP array dp of size (m+1) x (n+1) with all zeros. This represents that with zero '0's and zero '1's, the maximum subset size is zero.
-   Iterate Through Each String:
    -   For each string in strs, count the number of '0's (zeros) and '1's (ones).
    -   Update the DP table in reverse to ensure that each string is only counted once per iteration.
-   Update DP Table:
    -   Iterate from m down to zeros and from n down to ones.
    -   Update dp[i][j] to be the maximum of its current value or dp[i-zeros][j-ones] + 1.
-   Result:
    -   The value dp[m][n] will be the size of the largest subset that can be formed with at most m '0's and n '1's.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxForm(vector<string>& strs, int m, int n) {
        // Initialize a DP table with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1) to zero
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));

        // Iterate through each string in strs
        for (const string& s : strs) {
            // Count the number of '0's and '1's in the current string
            int zeros = count(s.begin(), s.end(), '0');
            int ones = s.size() - zeros;

            // Update the DP table in reverse to avoid overcounting the current string
            for (int i = m; i >= zeros; --i) {
                for (int j = n; j >= ones; --j) {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - zeros][j - ones] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        // The result is the maximum size of the subset with at most m '0's and n '1's
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(L * m * n):** Where L is the length of the strs array. For each string, we iterate over the DP table of size m x n.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(m * n):** The space complexity is due to the DP table of size (m+1) x (n+1).
