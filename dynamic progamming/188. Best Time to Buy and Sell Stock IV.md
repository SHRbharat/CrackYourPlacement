# [188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer k.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions: i.e. you may buy at most k times and sell at most k times.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### Approach Used :

-   Base Cases:
    -   If there are no prices or k is 0, the profit is 0.
-   DP Table Definition:
    -   Let dp[i][j] be the maximum profit that can be achieved with i transactions up to day j.
-   State Transition:
    -   The maximum profit for i transactions up to day j can be derived from the maximum of:
        -   Not transacting on day j: dp[i][j-1]
        -   Transacting on day j, which requires finding the best day to buy, i.e., prices[j] - prices[m] + dp[i-1][m] where m < j.
-   Optimization:
    -   Instead of iterating through m for each j, we can maintain a variable maxDiff that keeps track of the maximum difference between dp[i-1][m] - prices[m] as we progress through the days.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.empty()) return 0;
        int n = prices.size();
        
        // If k is greater than half of the number of days, it is the same as unlimited transactions.
        if (k >= n / 2) {
            int maxProfit = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
                if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                    maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
                }
            }
            return maxProfit;
        }
        
        // DP table
        vector<vector<int>> dp(k + 1, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
            int maxDiff = -prices[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], prices[j] + maxDiff);
                maxDiff = max(maxDiff, dp[i-1][j] - prices[j]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[k][n-1];
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(k * n):** where k is the number of allowed transactions, and n is the number of days.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(k * n):** for the DP table.
