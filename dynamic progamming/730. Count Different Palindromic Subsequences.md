# [730. Count Different Palindromic Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-different-palindromic-subsequences/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

Given a string s, return the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

A subsequence of a string is obtained by deleting zero or more characters from the string.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences a1, a2, ... and b1, b2, ... are different if there is some i for which ai != bi.

### Approach Used :

-   Dynamic Programming Table (dp):
    -   dp[i][j] represents the number of distinct palindromic subsequences in the substring s[i...j].
-   Initialization:
    -   Each single character s[i] is a palindrome by itself, so dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.
-   Filling the DP Table:
    -   The solution iterates over all possible substring lengths d (from 1 to n-1).
    -   For each substring s[i...j] where j = i + d:
        -   If s[i] == s[j], the computation considers three cases:
            -   No matching characters between s[i+1] and s[j-1]: Double the subsequences from s[i+1...j-1] and add 2 for the new palindromes formed by s[i] and s[j].
            -   Exactly one matching character between s[i+1] and s[j-1]: Double the subsequences from s[i+1...j-1] and add 1 for the new palindrome formed.
            -   More than one matching character: Double the subsequences from s[i+1...j-1] and subtract the overlapping palindromes within s[lo+1...hi-1] to avoid double counting.
        -   If s[i] != s[j], simply sum the subsequences in s[i...j-1] and s[i+1...j] and subtract the overlapping subsequences in s[i+1...j-1].
    -   Apply modulo 10^9 + 7 to keep the result within bounds.
-   Result:
    -   The final result for the entire string is stored in dp[0][n-1], which is returned as the output.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int countPalindromicSubsequences(string s) {
    constexpr int kMod = 1'000'000'007;
    const int n = s.length();
    // dp[i][j] := the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in
    // s[i..j]
    vector<vector<long>> dp(n, vector<long>(n));

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      dp[i][i] = 1;

    for (int d = 1; d < n; ++d)
      for (int i = 0; i + d < n; ++i) {
        const int j = i + d;
        if (s[i] == s[j]) {
          int lo = i + 1;
          int hi = j - 1;
          while (lo <= hi && s[lo] != s[i])
            ++lo;
          while (lo <= hi && s[hi] != s[i])
            --hi;
          if (lo > hi)
            dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] * 2 + 2;
          else if (lo == hi)
            dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] * 2 + 1;
          else
            dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] * 2 - dp[lo + 1][hi - 1];
        } else {
          dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + dp[i + 1][j] - dp[i + 1][j - 1];
        }
        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + kMod) % kMod;
      }

    return dp[0][n - 1];
  }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2):** where n is the length of the string.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n^2):** because of the dp.
