# [312. Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.

Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

### Approach Used :

-   Problem Transformation:
    -   The problem can be transformed by considering the balloons in terms of subproblems. The goal is to calculate the maximum coins that can be collected by bursting balloons between indices i and j.
    -   To simplify the problem, imagine that there are two extra balloons at the ends of the array, each with the value 1. This avoids edge cases when bursting the first or last balloon.
-   Dynamic Programming Table:
    -   Define a 2D DP table dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the maximum coins that can be obtained by bursting all balloons between indices i and j (inclusive).
    -   The transition is based on which balloon k is chosen to burst last among the balloons between i and j. The coins gained by bursting k would be nums[i-1] * nums[k] * nums[j+1], combined with the results of the subproblems to the left and right of k.
-   Filling the DP Table:
    -   We iterate over all possible subarray lengths, and for each length, iterate over all possible subarrays. For each subarray, try bursting every possible last balloon and update the DP table accordingly.
-   Final Result:
    -   The result is stored in dp[1][n], where n is the length of the original nums array after adding the two extra 1s.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCoins(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        nums.insert(nums.begin(), 1);  // Add 1 at the beginning
        nums.push_back(1);             // Add 1 at the end
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 2, vector<int>(n + 2, 0));
        
        // Length of the subarray we're considering
        for (int len = 1; len <= n; ++len) {
            for (int left = 1; left <= n - len + 1; ++left) {
                int right = left + len - 1;
                for (int k = left; k <= right; ++k) {
                    dp[left][right] = max(dp[left][right], 
                        dp[left][k - 1] + dp[k + 1][right] + nums[left - 1] * nums[k] * nums[right + 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[1][n];
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^3):** where n is the length of the original nums array. This is because we have three nested loops: one for the length of the subarray, one for the starting point of the subarray, and one for the possible last balloon to burst.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n^2):** or storing the DP table.
