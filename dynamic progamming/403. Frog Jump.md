# [403. Frog Jump](https://leetcode.com/problems/frog-jump/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of stones positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be 1 unit.

If the frog's last jump was k units, its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.

### Approach Used :

-   Optimal Solution: The approach uses dynamic programming with memoization. We simulate each possible jump the frog can make from each stone, checking if it can eventually reach the last stone.

-   Functionality: The function dfs(int pos, int lastJump) checks whether the frog can cross the river starting from the stone at position pos with the last jump being lastJump. It tries all possible jumps (lastJump - 1, lastJump, lastJump + 1) and recursively checks if the frog can reach the last stone from the new position.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canCross(vector<int>& stones) {
        // Create a map to store the index of each stone for quick access.
        unordered_map<int, int> stoneIndices;
        for (int i = 0; i < stones.size(); ++i) {
            stoneIndices[stones[i]] = i;
        }
        
        // Memoization map: stores the results of subproblems
        unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int, bool>> memo;
        
        // Helper function to recursively check if the frog can cross.
        function<bool(int, int)> dfs = [&](int pos, int lastJump) -> bool {
            // Base case: If we are on the last stone, the frog has successfully crossed.
            if (pos == stones.size() - 1) return true;
            
            // Check if this subproblem has already been solved.
            if (memo[pos].count(lastJump)) return memo[pos][lastJump];
            
            // Try all possible jumps: k-1, k, k+1.
            for (int jump = lastJump - 1; jump <= lastJump + 1; ++jump) {
                if (jump > 0 && stoneIndices.count(stones[pos] + jump)) {
                    if (dfs(stoneIndices[stones[pos] + jump], jump)) {
                        return memo[pos][lastJump] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            // If no valid jump leads to the last stone, return false.
            return memo[pos][lastJump] = false;
        };
        
        // Start the recursive check from the first stone with the first jump of 1 unit.
        return dfs(0, 0);
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n<sup>2<sup>):** where N is the number of stones, because the frog can potentially try every stone with every possible jump.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n<sup>2<sup>):** due to the memoization table storing results for subproblems.
