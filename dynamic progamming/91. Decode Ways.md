# [91. Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

You have intercepted a secret message encoded as a string of numbers. The message is decoded via the following mapping:

"1" -> 'A'

"2" -> 'B'

...

"25" -> 'Y'

"26" -> 'Z'

However, while decoding the message, you realize that there are many different ways you can decode the message because some codes are contained in other codes ("2" and "5" vs "25").

For example, "11106" can be decoded into:

"AAJF" with the grouping (1, 1, 10, 6)
"KJF" with the grouping (11, 10, 6)
The grouping (1, 11, 06) is invalid because "06" is not a valid code (only "6" is valid).
Note: there may be strings that are impossible to decode.

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. If the entire string cannot be decoded in any valid way, return 0.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

### Approach Used :

-   Dynamic Programming (DP) Table:
    -   Use a 1D DP array dp where dp[i] represents the number of ways to decode the substring s[0:i].
-   Initialization:
    -   dp[0] is 1, representing the base case: an empty string can be decoded in exactly one way (no decoding needed).
-   DP Transition:
    -   For each position i in the string s:
        -   Check if the single character ending at i is a valid decoding. If s[i] is not '0', then dp[i] can be updated by adding dp[i - 1] because the substring s[i] itself is a valid letter.
        -   Check if the two characters ending at i form a valid two-digit number between 10 and 26. If s[i-1:i] is between "10" and "26", then dp[i] can be updated by adding dp[i - 2] because the substring s[i-1:i] itself is a valid letter.
-   Result:
    -   The result will be in dp[n], where n is the length of the string s. This will represent the number of ways to decode the entire string.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numDecodings(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        if (n == 0 || s[0] == '0') return 0; // No valid decodings if string is empty or starts with '0'
        
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1; // Base case: Empty string
        
        // Only valid for length 1 strings
        dp[1] = s[0] != '0' ? 1 : 0;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            // Check single digit decoding
            if (s[i - 1] != '0') {
                dp[i] += dp[i - 1];
            }
            
            // Check two digit decoding
            int twoDigit = stoi(s.substr(i - 2, 2));
            if (twoDigit >= 10 && twoDigit <= 26) {
                dp[i] += dp[i - 2];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** We iterate through the string once, and for each position, we perform constant-time operations.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** We use a DP array of size n + 1.
