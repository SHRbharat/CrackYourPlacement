# [62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

### Approach Used :

-   Constructs a DP table to count paths in a bottom-up manner.
-   Each cell is filled based on the sum of paths from the top and left cells.
-   Provides an intuitive and straightforward way to solve the problem with O(m * n) time complexity and O(m * n) space complexity.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 1));

        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }

        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n):** due to filling the DP table.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(m * n):**  for the DP table.
