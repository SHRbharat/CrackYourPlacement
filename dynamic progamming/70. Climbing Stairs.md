# [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Easy/green)

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

### Approach Used :

-   Dynamic Programming (DP) Array: Use a DP array where dp[i] represents the number of ways to reach step i.
-   Base Cases:
    -   dp[0] = 1: There's one way to stay at the ground (do nothing).
    -   dp[1] = 1: There's one way to reach the first step (one 1-step).
-   Recurrence Relation:
    -   To reach step i, you can either come from step i-1 (1 step) or from step i-2 (2 steps).
    -   Thus, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2].
-   Filling the DP Array:
    -   Iterate from step 2 to n, filling the DP array using the recurrence relation.
-   Result:
    -   The value dp[n] gives the number of distinct ways to reach the top.


### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        
        // Create a DP array to store the number of ways to reach each step
        vector<int> dp(n + 1);
        dp[0] = 1; // One way to stay at the ground
        dp[1] = 1; // One way to reach the first step
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** The algorithm iterates from 2 to n, performing a constant-time operation at each step.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** to store dp array.
