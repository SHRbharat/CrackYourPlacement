# [64. Minimum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

### Approach Used :

-   Dynamic Programming (DP) Table:
    -   Use a 2D DP table dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum path sum to reach the cell (i, j).
-   Initialization:
    -   Set dp[0][0] to grid[0][0] because the starting cell has no previous path cost.
-   DP Transition:
    -   For each cell (i, j), compute dp[i][j] based on the minimum path cost to reach that cell from either the cell above (i-1, j) or the cell to the left (i, j-1):
        -   dp[i][j]=grid[i][j]+min(dp[i−1][j],dp[i][j−1])
    -   Ensure to handle boundary conditions where cells are at the top row or left column.
-   Result:
    -   The result will be in dp[m - 1][n - 1], which represents the minimum path sum to reach the bottom-right corner.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        // Create a DP table with the same dimensions as the grid
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        // Initialize the starting point
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];
        
        // Fill the first row (can only come from the left)
        for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j];
        }
        
        // Fill the first column (can only come from above)
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0];
        }
        
        // Fill the rest of the DP table
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        
        // The result is the minimum path sum to the bottom-right corner
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n):** You iterate through each cell of the m x n grid once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(m * n):** he space complexity is due to the dp table used
