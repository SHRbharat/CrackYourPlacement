# [1312. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-insertion-steps-to-make-a-string-palindrome/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

Given a string s. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string.

Return the minimum number of steps to make s palindrome.

A Palindrome String is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

### Approach Used :

-   The key idea is to determine the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) of the string s. Once we have the length of the LPS, the minimum number of insertions required to make the string a palindrome will be the difference between the length of s and the length of the LPS.

-   Steps:
    -   Find the Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS):
        -   The LPS of a string is the longest subsequence that is a palindrome.
        -   The minimum number of insertions needed to make the string a palindrome is given by len(s) - len(LPS).
    -   Dynamic Programming Table:
        -   Let dp[i][j] represent the length of the LPS in the substring s[i:j+1].
        -   If s[i] == s[j], then dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2.
        -   If s[i] != s[j], then dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]).
    -   Result:
        -   The result is len(s) - dp[0][n-1], where n is the length of the string s.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minInsertions(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        // Create a DP table initialized to 0
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        // Base case: Single character substrings are palindromes of length 1
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
        }
        
        // Fill the DP table
        for (int length = 2; length <= n; ++length) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; ++i) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // The length of the longest palindromic subsequence is dp[0][n-1]
        int lpsLength = dp[0][n-1];
        
        // Minimum insertions needed = length of s - length of LPS
        return n - lpsLength;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2):** where n is the length of the string s.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n^2):** due to the DP table.
