# [322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

### Approach Used :

-   Dynamic Programming (DP) Table:
    -   Use a 1D DP table dp where dp[i] represents the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount i.
-   Initialization:
    -   Initialize dp[0] to 0 because no coins are needed to make the amount 0.
    -   Initialize all other entries in dp to a large value (e.g., amount + 1), which represents an initially unreachable state.
-   DP Transition:
    -   For each coin in coins, and for each amount from the coin value up to amount, update dp[amount] using:
        -   dp[i]=min(dp[i],dp[iâˆ’coin]+1)
    -   This means if you can make amount i - coin with a certain number of coins, then you can make amount i with one more coin.
-   Result:
    -   After filling the DP table, the value at dp[amount] will represent the minimum number of coins needed to make up the given amount. If it remains as the initially set large value, return -1 indicating it's not possible.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        // DP table initialized to a large number
        vector<int> dp(amount + 1, amount + 1);
        dp[0] = 0; // Base case: 0 coins needed to make amount 0
        
        // Fill the DP table
        for (int i = 1; i <= amount; ++i) {
            for (const int& coin : coins) {
                if (i >= coin) {
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If dp[amount] is still amount + 1, it means it's not possible to make that amount
        return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(amount * n):** Where n is the number of different coin denominations. For each amount from 1 to amount, you iterate through all coin denominations.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(amount):** The space complexity is due to the DP table used to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount.
