# [71. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which begins with a slash '/', transform this path into its simplified canonical path.

In Unix-style file system context, a single period '.' signifies the current directory, a double period ".." denotes moving up one directory level, and multiple slashes such as "//" are interpreted as a single slash. In this problem, treat sequences of periods not covered by the previous rules (like "...") as valid names for files or directories.

The simplified canonical path should adhere to the following rules:

It must start with a single slash '/'.
Directories within the path should be separated by only one slash '/'.
It should not end with a slash '/', unless it's the root directory.
It should exclude any single or double periods used to denote current or parent directories.
Return the new path.

### Approach Used :

-   Use a stack to manage directory components by pushing valid directories and popping for .. commands. Construct the simplified path by combining stack elements with a leading / and handling edge cases.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string simplifyPath(string path) {
        stack<string> stk;
        string temp;
        
        // Append a trailing '/' to handle the last segment
        path += '/';
        
        for (char ch : path) {
            if (ch == '/') {
                if (temp == "..") {
                    if (!stk.empty()) {
                        stk.pop();
                    }
                } else if (temp != "" && temp != "." && temp != "..") {
                    stk.push(temp);
                }
                temp = "";
            } else {
                temp += ch;
            }
        }
        
        // Build the simplified path
        string result;
        while (!stk.empty()) {
            result = "/" + stk.top() + result;
            stk.pop();
        }
        
        return result.empty() ? "/" : result;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):**  This is because each character is processed once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** due to the space used by the stack to store directory names.
