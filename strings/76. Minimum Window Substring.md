# [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window 
substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

### Approach Used :

-   Character Frequency Maps
    - Two unordered maps are used:
    - `charCountMapT`: Stores the frequency of each character in string `t`.
    - `charCountMapS`: Tracks the frequency of characters in the current window of string `s`.

-   Sliding Window Technique
    - The algorithm employs a sliding window approach:
    - Two pointers, `leftPtr` and `rightPtr`, both start at the beginning of the string `s`.
    - The `rightPtr` expands the window by moving to the right, adding characters to the window and updating `charCountMapS`.

-   Window Validation
    - For each position of `rightPtr`:
    - The algorithm checks if the current window contains all characters of `t`.
    - This is done by ensuring `charCountMapS` contains at least as many of each character as `charCountMapT`.
    - If the window is valid:
    - The algorithm tries to shrink it from the left (`leftPtr`) to find the minimum size window that still contains all characters of `t`.

-Updating Minimum Window
    - Whenever a valid window is found:
    - The algorithm checks if it's smaller than the previously found window.
    - If it is, the `minWindowSize` and `windowStart` are updated.

-   Result
    - After the loop ends:
    - If a valid window was found, the function returns the substring starting from `windowStart` with a length of `minWindowSize`.
    - Otherwise, it returns an empty string. 

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string minWindow(string s, string t) {
        int minWindowSize = 1e9, windowStart = 0;
        int leftPtr = 0, rightPtr = 0;

        unordered_map<char, int> charCountMapS, charCountMapT;

        for (auto i : t)
            ++charCountMapT[i];

        while (rightPtr < s.size()) {
            ++charCountMapS[s[rightPtr++]];

            while (1) {
                bool isValidWindow = true;

                for (auto x : charCountMapT) {
                    if (charCountMapS[x.first] < x.second) {
                        isValidWindow = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }

                if (!isValidWindow)
                    break;

                if (rightPtr - leftPtr < minWindowSize) {
                    minWindowSize = rightPtr - leftPtr;
                    windowStart = leftPtr;
                }

                --charCountMapS[s[leftPtr++]];
            }
        }

        if (minWindowSize == 1e9)
            return "";
        else
            return s.substr(windowStart, minWindowSize);
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m + n):** 
    - The `rightPtr` pointer iterates over the entire string `s`, taking `O(m)` time.
    - The `leftPtr` pointer iterates over each character of `s`, also taking `O(m)` time.
    - Window validation involves iterating over the characters in `t`, taking `O(n)` time, but this is done in a constant number of steps.
    - Overall time complexity is `O(m + n)`.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(m+n):** due to maps.
