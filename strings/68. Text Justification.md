# [68. Text Justification](https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

Note:

A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
The input array words contains at least one word.

### Approach Used :

-   Group Words into Lines:
    -   Start by grouping words into lines such that the total length of words in each line plus the minimum number of spaces between them does not exceed maxWidth.
    -   For each group of words, calculate the total length of the words and the number of spaces needed to make the line fully justified.
-   Distribute Spaces Evenly:
    -   For each line (except the last one), distribute the spaces evenly between words. If there are extra spaces that cannot be evenly distributed, assign more spaces to the slots on the left.
-   Handle the Last Line:
    -   The last line should be left-justified. This means words are separated by a single space, and the remaining spaces are added at the end of the line.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> fullJustify(vector<string>& words, int maxWidth) {
        vector<string> result;
        int n = words.size();
        int index = 0;
        
        while (index < n) {
            int totalChars = words[index].length();
            int last = index + 1;
            
            while (last < n) {
                if (totalChars + 1 + words[last].length() > maxWidth) break;
                totalChars += 1 + words[last].length();
                last++;
            }
            
            string line;
            int numOfWords = last - index;
            int numOfSpaces = maxWidth - totalChars + (numOfWords - 1);
            
            if (last == n || numOfWords == 1) {
                // Last line or line with one word (left-justified)
                for (int i = index; i < last; ++i) {
                    line += words[i];
                    if (i < last - 1) line += ' ';
                }
                line += string(maxWidth - line.length(), ' ');
            } else {
                // Middle justified lines
                int spaceBetweenWords = numOfSpaces / (numOfWords - 1);
                int extraSpaces = numOfSpaces % (numOfWords - 1);
                
                for (int i = index; i < last; ++i) {
                    line += words[i];
                    if (i < last - 1) {
                        line += string(spaceBetweenWords + (i - index < extraSpaces ? 1 : 0), ' ');
                    }
                }
            }
            
            result.push_back(line);
            index = last;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** since each word is processed a constant number of times.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n * maxWidth):** where maxWidth is the maximum width of a line. This accounts for storing the resulting lines.
