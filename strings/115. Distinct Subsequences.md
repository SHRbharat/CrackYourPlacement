# [115. Distinct Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

### Approach Used :

-   Use a 2D DP table `dp[i][j]`, where each entry represents the number of distinct subsequences of the first `i` characters of `s` that match the first `j` characters of `t`.
    1. **Initialization**:
    - `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `i`:
        - An empty `t` can always be formed by any prefix of `s`.
    - `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j > 0`:
        - An empty `s` cannot match a non-empty `t`.

    2. **DP Transition**:
    - If `s[i-1] == t[j-1]`:
        - `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]`
        - This includes cases where the current character of `s` is used to match `t` or skipped.
    - If `s[i-1] != t[j-1]`:
        - `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`
        - This skips the current character of `s` since it doesn't match `t`.

    3. **Final Result**:
    - The answer is found in `dp[m][n]`, representing the number of distinct subsequences of `s` that equal `t`.


### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int numDistinct(string s, string t) {
    const int m = s.length();
    const int n = t.length();
    vector<vector<unsigned long>> dp(m + 1, vector<unsigned long>(n + 1));

    for (int i = 0; i <= m; ++i)
      dp[i][0] = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i)
      for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j)
        if (s[i - 1] == t[j - 1])
          dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j];
        else
          dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];

    return dp[m][n];
  }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n):** we iterate through each cell in a DP table

### Space Complexity:
- **O(m * n ):**dp table.
