# [25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

### Approach Used :

-   Initialization:
    -   Create a dummy node that points to the head of the list to handle edge cases easily.
    -   Use pointers pre, cur, and nex to keep track of the nodes while reversing.
    -   Count the total number of nodes in the list.
-   Reversing k nodes:
    -   If there are at least k nodes left, reverse the next k nodes using the cur, pre, and nex pointers.
    -   For each group, make the next node of pre (i.e., nex) point to the current node and update cur's next pointer to nex's next node.
    -   Move the pre pointer forward by k nodes.
-   Return:
    -   Finally, return the node after the dummy node, which is the new head of the reversed list.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseKGroup(ListNode* head, int k) {
        if (!head || k == 1) return head;

        ListNode *dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;
        ListNode *cur = dummy, *nex = dummy, *pre = dummy;
        int count = 0;
        
        while (cur->next) {
            cur = cur->next;
            count++;
        }
        
        while (count >= k) {
            cur = pre->next;
            nex = cur->next;
            for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) {
                cur->next = nex->next;
                nex->next = pre->next;
                pre->next = nex;
                nex = cur->next;
            }
            pre = cur;
            count -= k;
        }
        
        return dummy->next;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** Each node is processed at most twice (once for counting and once for reversing).

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** no extra space is used.
