# [138. Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.
Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.

### Approach Used :

-   Create Interleaved Copy Nodes:
    -   Traverse the original list and create a copy of each node. Insert each copy node right after its original node in the list. This allows us to easily map original nodes to their copies.
-   Assign Random Pointers:
    -   Traverse the modified list (with interleaved nodes) and assign the random pointers for the copy nodes. Since each copy node is directly next to its original node, you can easily find the corresponding copy node by using the next pointer.
-   Separate the Original and Copy Lists:
    -   Restore the original list to its original state by extracting the copy nodes and separating them from the original nodes.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        if (!head) return nullptr;

        // Step 1: Create interleaved copy nodes
        Node* curr = head;
        while (curr) {
            Node* copy = new Node(curr->val);
            copy->next = curr->next;
            curr->next = copy;
            curr = copy->next;
        }

        // Step 2: Assign random pointers for the copy nodes
        curr = head;
        while (curr) {
            Node* copy = curr->next;
            copy->random = (curr->random) ? curr->random->next : nullptr;
            curr = copy->next;
        }

        // Step 3: Separate the original and copy lists
        Node* newHead = head->next;
        Node* copyCurr = newHead;
        curr = head;
        while (curr) {
            curr->next = copyCurr->next;
            curr = curr->next;
            if (curr) copyCurr->next = curr->next;
            copyCurr = copyCurr->next;
        }

        return newHead;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** Each node is processed a constant number of times.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** for storing the new nodes in the copied list.
