# [40. Combination Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

### Approach Used :

-   Sort the Candidates: Sorting helps to manage duplicates easily.
-   Backtracking Function: Use a recursive function to build the combinations.
    -   If target is 0, a valid combination is found, and it's added to the result.
    -   Loop through candidates starting from start index.
    -   Skip duplicate elements by checking if the current candidate is the same as the previous one.
    -   If the current candidate is greater than the target, break out of the loop since no further candidates can be part of a valid combination.
    -   Include the current candidate and recurse with the reduced target and the next start index.
    -   Backtrack by removing the last added candidate.
-   Avoid Duplicates: Skip duplicate candidates to avoid duplicate combinations in the result.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum2(vector<int>& candidates, int target) {
        vector<vector<int>> results;
        vector<int> combination;
        sort(candidates.begin(), candidates.end());
        backtrack(candidates, target, 0, combination, results);
        return results;
    }
    
private:
    void backtrack(vector<int>& candidates, int target, int start, vector<int>& combination, vector<vector<int>>& results) {
        if (target == 0) {
            results.push_back(combination);
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = start; i < candidates.size(); ++i) {
            if (i > start && candidates[i] == candidates[i - 1]) continue; // Skip duplicates
            if (candidates[i] > target) break; // No need to continue if the current candidate exceeds the target
            
            combination.push_back(candidates[i]);
            backtrack(candidates, target - candidates[i], i + 1, combination, results);
            combination.pop_back();
        }
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(2<sup>n</sup>):** The number of subsets of a given set of n elements is 2<sup>n</sup>. In the worst case, the backtracking algorithm explores all subsets.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** The space complexity is primarily due to the recursion stack, which can go as deep as the number of elements n in the worst case. Additionally, the combination vector uses space proportional to the number of elements being processed at any point.
