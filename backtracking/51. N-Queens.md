# [51. N-Queens](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

### Approach Used :

-   Backtracking Approach:
    -   The idea is to place queens one by one in different rows, starting from the first row.
    -   For each row, try placing the queen in each column and check if it's safe to place the queen there.
    -   If it's safe, place the queen and recursively try to place the queen in the next row.
    -   If placing the queen in any column in the current row leads to a solution, return that solution.
    -   If none of the columns work, backtrack by removing the queen and trying the next column.
-   State Representation:
    -   Use a vector<string> to represent the chessboard, where each string represents a row, and each character in the string represents a cell (either a queen 'Q' or an empty space '.').
-   Safety Check:
    -   Ensure no other queen is in the same column.
    -   Ensure no other queen is in the left diagonal (row - col is constant).
    -   Ensure no other queen is in the right diagonal (row + col is constant).

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> solveNQueens(int n) {
        vector<vector<string>> solutions;
        vector<string> board(n, string(n, '.'));
        vector<int> cols(n, 0);            // Tracks if a column is occupied
        vector<int> d1(2 * n - 1, 0);      // Tracks if a left diagonal is occupied
        vector<int> d2(2 * n - 1, 0);      // Tracks if a right diagonal is occupied
        solve(0, n, board, cols, d1, d2, solutions);
        return solutions;
    }

private:
    void solve(int row, int n, vector<string>& board, vector<int>& cols, vector<int>& d1, vector<int>& d2, vector<vector<string>>& solutions) {
        if (row == n) {
            solutions.push_back(board);
            return;
        }

        for (int col = 0; col < n; ++col) {
            if (cols[col] || d1[row - col + n - 1] || d2[row + col]) continue;

            // Place the queen
            board[row][col] = 'Q';
            cols[col] = d1[row - col + n - 1] = d2[row + col] = 1;

            // Recurse for the next row
            solve(row + 1, n, board, cols, d1, d2, solutions);

            // Backtrack
            board[row][col] = '.';
            cols[col] = d1[row - col + n - 1] = d2[row + col] = 0;
        }
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n!):** because there are N possibilities to place the first queen, N-1 for the second, and so on.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n^2):** to store the board configuration and additional space for the column and diagonal trackers.
