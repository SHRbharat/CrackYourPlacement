# [37. Sudoku Solver](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
The '.' character indicates empty cells.

### Approach Used :

-   Find Empty Cells:
    -   Traverse the board to find an empty cell, denoted by '.'.
-   Try Possible Numbers:
    -   For the empty cell, try placing numbers from 1 to 9 and check if placing the number violates any Sudoku rules.
-   Check Validity:
    -   Ensure that the number does not already exist in the same row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid.
-   Recursive Backtracking:
    -   Place the number and recursively attempt to solve the rest of the board.
    -   If placing the number leads to a solution, return true.
    -   If not, remove the number (backtrack) and try the next number.
-   Base Case:
    -   If all cells are filled correctly, the Sudoku is solved.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void solveSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        solve(board);
    }

private:
    // Function to check if placing num at board[row][col] is valid
    bool isValid(vector<vector<char>>& board, int row, int col, char num) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) {
            // Check if num is already in the same row or column
            if (board[row][i] == num || board[i][col] == num) {
                return false;
            }
            // Check if num is already in the same 3x3 sub-box
            if (board[3 * (row / 3) + i / 3][3 * (col / 3) + i % 3] == num) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Backtracking function to solve the Sudoku
    bool solve(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        for (int row = 0; row < 9; ++row) {
            for (int col = 0; col < 9; ++col) {
                if (board[row][col] == '.') {
                    // Try all possible numbers from 1 to 9
                    for (char num = '1'; num <= '9'; ++num) {
                        if (isValid(board, row, col, num)) {
                            board[row][col] = num;  // Place the number

                            // Recursively try to solve the rest of the board
                            if (solve(board)) {
                                return true;
                            }

                            // If it didn't work out, backtrack
                            board[row][col] = '.';
                        }
                    }
                    return false;  // If no number is valid, return false
                }
            }
        }
        return true;  // If the board is fully filled
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(9^(N^2)):** due to the potential number of configurations, but in practice, it is much faster due to early termination and pruning of invalid configurations.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(N^2):** for the recursion stack and the board, where N is the size of the board (9 in this case).
