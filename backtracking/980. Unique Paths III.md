# [980. Unique Paths III](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-iii/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

You are given an m x n integer array grid where grid[i][j] could be:

1 representing the starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
2 representing the ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
0 representing empty squares we can walk over.
-1 representing obstacles that we cannot walk over.
Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

### Approach Used :

-   Grid Parsing:
    -   Identify the starting (1) and ending (2) positions in the grid.
    -   Count the total number of non-obstacle cells that need to be visited, which includes empty cells (0) and the ending square (2).
-   DFS with Backtracking:
    -   Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths from the starting square.
    -   Keep track of visited cells to ensure each cell is visited exactly once.
    -   Use backtracking to undo the visit and explore other possible paths.
    -   Stop the search when reaching the ending square and check if all non-obstacle cells have been visited.
-   Base Cases:
    -   If the path reaches the ending square and all required cells have been visited, it's a valid path.
    -   If the path exceeds the bounds or hits an obstacle, backtrack.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePathsIII(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        const int m = grid.size();
        const int n = grid[0].size();
        int startX, startY, endX, endY;
        int totalCells = 0;

        // Find start, end positions and count non-obstacle cells
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    startX = i;
                    startY = j;
                } else if (grid[i][j] == 2) {
                    endX = i;
                    endY = j;
                }
                if (grid[i][j] != -1) {
                    ++totalCells;
                }
            }
        }

        return dfs(grid, startX, startY, endX, endY, totalCells);
    }

private:
    // Directions for moving in the grid (right, down, left, up)
    vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};

    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x, int y, int endX, int endY, int totalCells) {
        // If out of bounds or hit an obstacle
        if (x < 0 || x >= grid.size() || y < 0 || y >= grid[0].size() || grid[x][y] == -1) {
            return 0;
        }
        // If we reached the end
        if (x == endX && y == endY) {
            return (totalCells == 1) ? 1 : 0;  // Check if all cells are visited
        }
        // If already visited
        if (grid[x][y] == 3) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Mark as visited
        grid[x][y] = 3;
        int paths = 0;

        // Explore all 4 directions
        for (const auto& dir : directions) {
            int newX = x + dir.first;
            int newY = y + dir.second;
            paths += dfs(grid, newX, newY, endX, endY, totalCells - 1);
        }

        // Unmark as visited
        grid[x][y] = 0;
        return paths;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(4^(mn)):** where mn is the number of cells in the grid. This is because each cell can be visited in multiple ways and has 4 possible directions to explore.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(mn):** which accounts for the recursion stack and the grid space used for marking visited cells.
