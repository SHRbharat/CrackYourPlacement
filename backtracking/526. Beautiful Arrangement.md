# [526. Beautiful Arrangement](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Suppose you have n integers labeled 1 through n. A permutation of those n integers perm (1-indexed) is considered a beautiful arrangement if for every i (1 <= i <= n), either of the following is true:

perm[i] is divisible by i.
i is divisible by perm[i].
Given an integer n, return the number of the beautiful arrangements that you can construct.

### Approach Used :

-   Backtracking: Use a recursive function to explore all possible permutations.
    -   If pos exceeds n, it means a valid permutation has been found, so return 1.
    -   Iterate through numbers from 1 to n.
    -   For each number, if it hasn't been used and satisfies the condition for the current position (i % pos == 0 or pos % i == 0), mark it as visited and recurse to the next position.
    -   After recursion, backtrack by unmarking the number.
-   Validation: For each position i, ensure the number perm[i] satisfies either perm[i]%i==0 or i%perm[i]==0.
-   Optimization: Use a visited array to keep track of the numbers that have already been used in the current permutation.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countArrangement(int n) {
        vector<int> visited(n + 1, 0); // To track visited numbers
        return count(1, n, visited);
    }

private:
    int count(int pos, int n, vector<int>& visited) {
        if (pos > n) return 1; // All positions filled successfully
        
        int totalCount = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (!visited[i] && (i % pos == 0 || pos % i == 0)) {
                visited[i] = 1; // Mark the number as visited
                totalCount += count(pos + 1, n, visited); // Recurse for the next position
                visited[i] = 0; // Backtrack
            }
        }
        
        return totalCount;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n!):** The algorithm explores all possible permutations of n numbers, which is n!.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** The space complexity is due to the recursion stack and the visited vector, both of which can go as deep as n.
