# [424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

### Approach Used :

-   We use a sliding window to track the substring and a frequency array to keep count of characters within the window.
-   Adjust the window size by shifting the left pointer when the number of required replacements exceeds k.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int characterReplacement(string s, int k) {
        int max_len = 0, max_count = 0, left = 0;
        vector<int> count(26, 0);

        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); ++right) {
            max_count = max(max_count, ++count[s[right] - 'A']);
            
            while (right - left + 1 - max_count > k) {
                --count[s[left] - 'A'];
                ++left;
            }
            
            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1);
        }

        return max_len;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):**  Each character is processed at most twice (once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer).

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** because the frequency array has a fixed size of 26 for uppercase English letters.
