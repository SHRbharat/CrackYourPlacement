# [1610. Maximum Number of Visible Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-visible-points/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

You are given an array points, an integer angle, and your location, where location = [posx, posy] and points[i] = [xi, yi] both denote integral coordinates on the X-Y plane.

Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You cannot move from your position, but you can rotate. In other words, posx and posy cannot be changed. Your field of view in degrees is represented by angle, determining how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let d be the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your field of view is the inclusive range of angles [d - angle/2, d + angle/2].

You can see some set of points if, for each point, the angle formed by the point, your position, and the immediate east direction from your position is in your field of view.

There can be multiple points at one coordinate. There may be points at your location, and you can always see these points regardless of your rotation. Points do not obstruct your vision to other points.

Return the maximum number of points you can see.

### Approach Used :

-   *Convert points to angles:* Calculate the angle of each point relative to the location using the atan2 function, which gives the angle in radians. Convert it to degrees.
-   *Handle same location points:* Count the number of points that are at the same location as the given location since they are always visible.
-   *Sort and extend angles:* Sort the angles and extend the list by adding each angle plus 360 degrees to handle the circular nature of angles.
-   *Sliding window:* Use a sliding window approach to find the maximum number of points within the given angle. The window's right edge expands to include points while the left edge adjusts to maintain the window's size within the given angle.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int visiblePoints(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points, int angle, std::vector<int>& location) {
        std::vector<double> angles;
        int same_location_count = 0;
        const double PI = acos(-1);
        
        for (const auto& point : points) {
            if (point[0] == location[0] && point[1] == location[1]) {
                same_location_count++;
                continue;
            }
            double angle = atan2(point[1] - location[1], point[0] - location[0]) * 180 / PI;
            angles.push_back(angle);
        }

        std::sort(angles.begin(), angles.end());
        int n = angles.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            angles.push_back(angles[i] + 360);
        }

        int max_visible = 0, left = 0;
        for (int right = 0; right < angles.size(); ++right) {
            while (angles[right] - angles[left] > angle) {
                ++left;
            }
            max_visible = std::max(max_visible, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return max_visible + same_location_count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(nlogn):** overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** for storing the angles and the extended angles list, where n is the number of points.
