# [739. Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

### Approach Used :

-   Use a Stack:
    -   We'll use a stack to store the indices of the days. The stack will help us keep track of the days with temperatures that we haven't yet found a warmer temperature for.
-   Iterate Through the Temperatures:
    -   For each day, if the current day's temperature is warmer than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack, we pop the stack and calculate the number of days waited for a warmer temperature.
    -   If the stack is empty or the current day's temperature is not warmer than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack, we push the current day's index onto the stack.
-   Result Array:
    -   The result array will store the number of days waited for each day to get a warmer temperature.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> dailyTemperatures(std::vector<int>& temperatures) {
        int n = temperatures.size();
        std::vector<int> answer(n, 0); // Initialize the result array with 0s
        std::stack<int> stk; // Stack to store indices of the days
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // While stack is not empty and the current temperature is greater than
            // the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack
            while (!stk.empty() && temperatures[i] > temperatures[stk.top()]) {
                int index = stk.top();
                stk.pop();
                answer[index] = i - index;
            }
            // Push the current index onto the stack
            stk.push(i);
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** Each index is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, resulting in linear time complexity.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** due to stack.
