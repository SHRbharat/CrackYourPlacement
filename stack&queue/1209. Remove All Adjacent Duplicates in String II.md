# [1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string-ii/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

You are given a string s and an integer k, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and equal letters from s and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

### Approach Used :

-   Stack-Based Tracking:
    -   Use a stack to keep track of characters and their consecutive counts.
    -   Each entry in the stack is a pair where the first element is the character and the second is the count of consecutive occurrences.
-   Processing the String:
    -   Traverse through each character of the string.
    -   If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has the same character, increment the count.
    -   If the count reaches k, pop the top element from the stack (indicating removal of these k characters).
    -   If the character is different or the stack is empty, push it onto the stack with a count of 1.
-   Building the Result:
    -   After processing all characters, construct the final string based on the remaining characters and their counts in the stack.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicates(string s, int k) {
        stack<pair<char, int>> stk;  // Stack to store characters and their counts
        
        for (char c : s) {
            if (!stk.empty() && stk.top().first == c) {
                // If the current character is the same as the top of the stack
                stk.top().second++;
                // If count reaches k, pop the stack (remove the k characters)
                if (stk.top().second == k) {
                    stk.pop();
                }
            } else {
                // If the stack is empty or current character is different
                stk.push({c, 1});
            }
        }
        
        // Construct the final result from the stack
        string result;
        while (!stk.empty()) {
            pair t = stk.top();
            char char_ = t.first;
            int count = t.second;
            stk.pop();
            result = string(count, char_) + result;  // Prepend the characters
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** Each character is processed once and added to or removed from the stack in constant time.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** n the worst case, the stack might store all characters if no k removals are performed..
