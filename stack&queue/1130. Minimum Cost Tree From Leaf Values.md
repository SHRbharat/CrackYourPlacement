# [1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-tree-from-leaf-values/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Given an array arr of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:

Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
The values of arr correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree.
The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree, respectively.
Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node. It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer.

A node is a leaf if and only if it has zero children.

### Approach Used :

-   Use a stack to store the elements of the array while maintaining a monotonically decreasing sequence.
-   For each element in the array, if the current element is greater than the top of the stack, pop from the stack. The popped element will be used as an internal node, and its value will be the product of the smaller of the current element or the next top of the stack.
-   Keep track of the sum of all such products (non-leaf nodes).
-   At the end, if there are still elements in the stack, continue popping and multiplying adjacent elements until one element remains.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mctFromLeafValues(vector<int>& arr) {
        int res = 0;
        stack<int> st;
        
        for (int a : arr) {
            while (!st.empty() && st.top() <= a) {
                int mid = st.top();
                st.pop();
                if (!st.empty()) {
                    res += mid * min(st.top(), a);
                } else {
                    res += mid * a;
                }
            }
            st.push(a);
        }
        
        // Remaining elements in the stack
        while (st.size() > 1) {
            int top = st.top();
            st.pop();
            res += top * st.top();
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** array is traversed once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** use of stack.
