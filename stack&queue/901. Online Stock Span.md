# [901. Online Stock Span](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Medium/yellow)

Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.

The span of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price of that day.

For example, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,2,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 2, then the span of today is 4 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 2 for 4 consecutive days.
Also, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,34,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 8, then the span of today is 3 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 8 for 3 consecutive days.
Implement the StockSpanner class:

StockSpanner() Initializes the object of the class.
int next(int price) Returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is price.
 
### Approach Used :

-   To solve the problem of calculating the stock span efficiently, we can use a stack. The idea is to maintain a stack that stores pairs of stock prices and their corresponding spans. As we iterate through each price, we can use the stack to find out the span for the current price by popping out all prices from the stack that are less than or equal to the current price. The span for the current price is then the sum of all the spans of the popped elements plus one (for the current day).

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class StockSpanner {
public:
    // Stack to store pairs of (price, span)
    stack<pair<int, int>> st;
    
    StockSpanner() {
        
    }
    
    int next(int price) {
        int span = 1; // Span for the current price
        
        // While stack is not empty and the top element's price is less than or equal to current price
        while (!st.empty() && st.top().first <= price) {
            span += st.top().second; // Accumulate spans
            st.pop(); // Remove the element from the stack
        }
        
        // Push the current price and its span onto the stack
        st.push({price, span});
        
        return span;
    }
};
