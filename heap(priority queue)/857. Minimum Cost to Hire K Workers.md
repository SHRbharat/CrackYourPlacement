# [857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.

We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:

Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.
Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

### Approach Used :

-   Ratio Calculation and Sorting:
    -   For each worker, calculate the ratio of their wage to their quality. This ratio represents how much to pay per unit quality.
    -   Create a vector of pairs where each pair consists of the ratio and the worker's quality.
    -   Sort this vector by the wage-to-quality ratio in ascending order.
-    Maintaining Quality Sum with Max-Heap:
    -   Use a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the top k highest quality workers. This allows efficient management of the largest qualities.
    -   As you iterate through the sorted list of workers, add each worker's quality to the heap and update the total quality sum.
    -   If the heap exceeds size k, remove the worker with the highest quality (the top of the max-heap) and adjust the quality sum accordingly.
-   Cost Calculation:
    -   When the heap size equals k, calculate the cost using the current ratio and the sum of the qualities in the heap.
    -   Track the minimum cost encountered during the iteration.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  double mincostToHireWorkers(vector<int>& quality, vector<int>& wage, int k) {
    double ans = DBL_MAX;
    int qualitySum = 0;
    // (wagePerQuality, quality) sorted by wagePerQuality
    vector<pair<double, int>> workers;
    priority_queue<int> maxHeap;

    for (int i = 0; i < quality.size(); ++i)
      workers.emplace_back((double)wage[i] / quality[i], quality[i]);

    ranges::sort(workers);

    for (const auto& [wagePerQuality, q] : workers) {
      maxHeap.push(q);
      qualitySum += q;
      if (maxHeap.size() > k)
        qualitySum -= maxHeap.top(), maxHeap.pop();
      if (maxHeap.size() == k)
        ans = min(ans, qualitySum * wagePerQuality);
    }

    return ans;
  }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n log k + n log n):** where n is the number of workers;Sorting the workers based on the ratio takes O(n log n).Maintaining the max-heap for k elements involves O(n log k) operations.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n+k):** The space for storing the workers vector is O(n).The space for the max-heap is O(k).
