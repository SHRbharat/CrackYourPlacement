# [239. Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.

### Approach Used :

-   Use a Deque:
    -   The deque will help maintain the indices of the elements in a way that allows us to quickly access the maximum element in the current window.
-   Maintain Indices in Deque:
    -   The deque will store indices of elements in a way such that the element corresponding to the front of the deque is the maximum element in the current window.
-   Slide the Window:
    -   For each new element in the window, remove indices from the back of the deque if the current element is greater than the elements represented by those indices.
    -   Remove the index from the front of the deque if it's out of the bounds of the current window.
-   Update the Maximums:
    -   The maximum element of the current window is always at the front of the deque.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maxSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        vector<int> result;
        deque<int> dq;  // Deque to store indices

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            // Remove indices of elements not in the current window
            if (!dq.empty() && dq.front() == i - k) {
                dq.pop_front();
            }

            // Remove indices of all elements smaller than the current element
            while (!dq.empty() && nums[dq.back()] < nums[i]) {
                dq.pop_back();
            }

            // Add current element's index at the back of the deque
            dq.push_back(i);

            // The maximum of the current window is at the front of the deque
            if (i >= k - 1) {
                result.push_back(nums[dq.front()]);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** where N is the number of elements in nums. Each element is added and removed from the deque at most once.
### Space Complexity:
- **O(k):**  where K is the size of the sliding window, as the deque stores at most K elements.
