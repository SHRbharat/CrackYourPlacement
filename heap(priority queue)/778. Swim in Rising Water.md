### Approach Used :

-   Priority Queue Initialization:
    -   Use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the cells to be processed based on the current elevation (water level). This allows processing cells with the minimum elevation first.
-   Processing the Grid:
    -   Start from the top-left cell (0, 0) and initialize the priority queue with this cell's elevation and position.
    -   Maintain a seen matrix to track cells that have already been processed to avoid revisiting.
-   Exploration:
    -   Extract the cell with the minimum elevation from the priority queue.
    -   Update the maximum elevation encountered (ans) to ensure that you account for the highest elevation encountered on the path.
    -   Check if the destination cell (n-1, n-1) has been reached. If yes, return the current maximum elevation.
    -   For each cell, explore its four possible directions (up, down, left, right). If the neighboring cell is within bounds and hasn't been processed, add it to the priority queue.
-   Termination:
    -   The loop terminates when the destination cell is reached. The result (ans) will be the minimum time required to reach the bottom-right cell from the top-left cell.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int swimInWater(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    constexpr int dirs[4][2] = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
    const int n = grid.size();
    int ans = grid[0][0];
    using T = tuple<int, int, int>;  // (grid[i][j], i, j)
    priority_queue<T, vector<T>, greater<>> minHeap;
    vector<vector<bool>> seen(n, vector<bool>(n));

    minHeap.emplace(grid[0][0], 0, 0);
    seen[0][0] = true;

    while (!minHeap.empty()) {
      const auto [height, i, j] = minHeap.top();
      minHeap.pop();
      ans = max(ans, height);
      if (i == n - 1 && j == n - 1)
        break;
      for (const auto& [dx, dy] : dirs) {
        const int x = i + dx;
        const int y = j + dy;
        if (x < 0 || x == n || y < 0 || y == n)
          continue;
        if (seen[x][y])
          continue;
        minHeap.emplace(grid[x][y], x, y);
        seen[x][y] = true;
      }
    }

    return ans;
  }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N^2 log N):** Each cell is added to the priority queue once, and each insertion and extraction from the priority queue takes O(log N). Thus, with N^2 cells, the time complexity is O(N^2 log N).

### Space Complexity:
- **O(N^2):** Space is required for the seen matrix and the priority queue which stores up to N^2 cells.
