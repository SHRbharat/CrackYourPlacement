# [871. Minimum Number of Refueling Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-refueling-stops/description/)

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Level/Hard/red)

A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles east of the starting position.

There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array stations where stations[i] = [positioni, fueli] indicates that the ith gas station is positioni miles east of the starting position and has fueli liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.

Return the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination. If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.

Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.

### Approach Used :

-   Initialization:
    -   Start with the current position and fuel at the starting point.
    -   Use a max-heap to store the amount of fuel from gas stations that have been passed but not used yet.
-   Traverse Gas Stations:
    -   As you move from one gas station to the next, check if you can reach the next gas station with the current fuel.
    -   If not, refuel from the gas stations with the maximum fuel available in the heap until you can reach the next station or the destination.
-   Refueling:
    -   When you cannot proceed further, use the heap to refuel from the gas stations that have been passed.
    -   Count each refueling action.
-   Final Check:
    -   After processing all gas stations, check if you have enough fuel to reach the destination.
-   Edge Cases:
    -   If it's impossible to reach the destination, return -1.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minRefuelStops(int target, int startFuel, vector<vector<int>>& stations) {
        // Add a final station at the destination with 0 fuel
        stations.push_back({target, 0});
        
        int n = stations.size();
        int currFuel = startFuel;
        int stops = 0;
        int prevPos = 0;
        
        // Max-heap to store available fuel at past stations
        priority_queue<int> maxHeap;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int pos = stations[i][0];
            int fuel = stations[i][1];
            
            // Move the car to the current station
            currFuel -= (pos - prevPos);
            prevPos = pos;
            
            // If the car runs out of fuel, refuel from the max heap
            while (currFuel < 0 && !maxHeap.empty()) {
                currFuel += maxHeap.top();
                maxHeap.pop();
                ++stops;
            }
            
            // If after refueling we still can't reach the destination
            if (currFuel < 0) {
                return -1;
            }
            
            // Add the current station's fuel to the max heap
            maxHeap.push(fuel);
        }
        
        return stops;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n log n):** This complexity arises from inserting and removing elements from the heap.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n):** heap and stations.
